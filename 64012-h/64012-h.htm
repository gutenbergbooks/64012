<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HIS is a true story.</p>

<p>It all happened through George
Henry not believing in the fairies, just
as some boys but <em>very</em> few girls would do.</p>

<p>Boys believe in Red Indians and pirates, and
think fairies are all stuff and nonsense; but they
are quite wrong, for Puck can turn himself into
anybody or anything he chooses. So if one day
when you are ploughing the foaming main you
sight a pirate ship flying the skull and crossbones
at the masthead, it may not be a pirate at
all, but only Puck himself.</p>

<p>Beware! If he catches you he will make you
walk the fairy plank, and you will fall off it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<em>splash!</em> right into Fairyland, and find yourself
turned into a cross old frog or something quite
as disagreeable.</p>

<p>This story should be read aloud. You should
seat yourselves in a ring&mdash;that will please the
fairies&mdash;and look happy, even if you aren't as
happy as you might be. Sour looks curdle
cream and stories as well.</p>

<p>"What!" you say. "Dragons and witches
and giants! Do you expect us to believe in
<em>them</em>?"</p>

<p>Well, why not? Do you only believe in what
you have seen? All the best books are full of
wonders like these, and everything wonderful
<em>must</em> be true.</p>

<p>So, once again, this is a true story.</p>

<p>Now turn to the next page and begin!</p>

<p class="p6"><em>George Arrives</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">G</span>EORGE HENRY was born under a
lucky star, which means that a star
laughed when he came into the world.
This happens to very, <em>very</em> few of us; perhaps it
is because we are born naughty and ready to be
stood in the corner at once.</p>

<p>The fairies knew all about George Henry,
however, and were delighted, for he was a darling
boy. Puck brought them the news wrapped up
in a leaf and packed inside a nutshell in order
to keep it dry.</p>

<p>Of course you have heard of Puck. He is the
little fairy who often plays mischievous tricks
upon people; but if children behave nicely he is
always ready to be their friend.</p>

<p>Santa Claus often pays him a visit about
Christmas-time in order to find out if any
children have not been as good as gold during
the past year. Then the naughty children find
their stockings empty on Christmas morning,
and wish and wish&mdash;too late&mdash;that they had
thought in time of what Father and Mother had
told them.</p>

<p>Well, the fairies danced that night in the
greenwood to the music of the cricket, the grasshopper,
and the frog. Puck told them all about
George Henry and what a very fine boy he was
going to be.</p>

<p>George's father and mother thought so too,
and Nurse said that he was the finest child she
had ever seen. Nurses <em>always</em> know.</p>

<p>The birds and animals soon heard the news
too, and there was such a chattering, jabbering,
twittering, squeaking, and I really don't know
how to tell you what other curious noises in the
wood that night.</p>

<p>This 'wonder-child,' as the fairies called him,
was named George Henry&mdash;'George' after his
grandfather, who gave him a large silver
drinking-mug as a christening present, and
'Henry' after his father. His mother would
have liked to add 'Alexander' as a third name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
but it was given, after all, to a new black, woolly
puppy which came into the house about this
time; so that was all right. It is a great pity
to waste fine names like Alexander.</p>

<p>George Henry and Alexander grew up
together and were great friends. Alexander
learned to walk long before his little playmate,
who used to toddle along holding on to the dog's
tail, and very often falling over on top of him
when his legs grew tired.</p>

<p>As soon as he got past his toddle-days he
loved to walk about everywhere and see everything.</p>

<p>The world was full of the most wonderful
things; there was a pigsty in which lived a
family of little pigs with curly tails. They used
to squeak "Good-morning" to him every time
he passed by.</p>

<p>He loved their curly tails, and often tried to
make Alexander's tail like theirs, but it was of
no use. It either stood straight up on end or
else disappeared between his legs.</p>

<p>It was fine, too, to see the geese marching
along like soldiers with the old gander at their
head; to watch the old hen fussing and clucking
after her little fluffy chicks, who would
never come home when they were told&mdash;"Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
naughty little boys, you know," said
Nurse.</p>

<p>It would take hours to tell you all the things
Alexander and he saw together&mdash;the animals,
the birds, the trees, the flowers; and they
all loved him. But he never saw the
fairies&mdash;though they often waved their little
hands to him; and Puck sometimes rode on
Alexander's back through the woods and led
them to all the prettiest spots&mdash;but George
never knew.</p>

<p>By and by, when they had grown up a little
more, and George was in sailor trousers, while
Alexander had a great big bark which quite
made you jump the first time you heard it,
Father and Mother began to wonder what
George would be when he became a man.</p>

<p>He loved playing at soldiers, and had boxes
and boxes full of them which Grandfather and
Grandmother, uncles and aunts, and other kind
people gave him from time to time. He played
with them on the nursery floor, up and down
stairs until the housemaid, Anne, fell over
them, on his bed when he ought to have
been asleep, until Father said: "Ah, the boy
will be a general and win great battles when
he grows up!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"No!" answered Mother. "George is born
for something better than <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>He knew all about everything in the shop
windows, better than even the people to whom
the shops belonged.</p>

<p>"He will be a great merchant!" said his
grandfather.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" answered Mother. "Buying and
selling? My little George was not born for
<em>that</em>."</p>

<p>He began to use paper and pencil, and then a
paint-box.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the aunt who had given him all
these things. "George will be a great artist
who will draw and paint most wonderful
pictures."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" replied Mother. "George was
born to do something <em>great</em>. He can always
draw pictures to amuse himself."</p>

<p>Then he learned to write, and wrote the most
wonderful stories which no one except himself
could understand.</p>

<p>"He will be a great writer and write stories
which everybody will read," said his grandmother.</p>

<p>"I never heard such nonsense!" cried his
mother, quite vexed. "Don't I tell you that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
is going to do <em>great</em> things? Anybody can write
stories; besides, he might sit up late at night
and catch colds and I don't know what else if
he began writing stories!"</p>

<p>Puck was delighted to hear them all guessing
in this way, and laughed until he fell off the top
of a big sunflower on which he was sitting.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" he cried. "How funny these big
people are!" And he flew away into the wood
to tell the fairies all about it.</p>

<p>They laughed and laughed for days and
days, and were never tired of hearing Puck
talk like Grandfather, Father, Mother, and
Aunt.</p>

<p>Even the old bull-frog in the large pond,
right in the middle of the darkest part of
the wood, croaked "<em>Ker-ek!</em>" which was <em>his</em>
way of laughing. He always had a cold,
poor fellow, because his feet were never, <em>never</em>
dry, and nobody ever thinks of giving frogs
medicine. Perhaps they have neither nurses
nor aunts.</p>

<p>And so the days and months went by, and
presently George was big enough to go to
school. It was quite a nice school, so Puck
said, for he went there when he had time. Puck
liked to listen to the fairy stories best of all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and often sat on the teacher's shoulder and
whispered in her ear. You would have been
surprised and delighted to hear what splendid
stories she told the children on those days, and
she could <em>never</em> imagine how they came into her
head.</p>

<p>Now, it is a very sad thing to have to
tell you, but Puck soon found out that
George did not believe that there were any
fairies, nor&mdash;worse still&mdash;that there ever had
been any.</p>

<p>One day he actually fell asleep when the very
best story of all was being told! Puck didn't
know what was to be done, and the fairies
couldn't help him, for they had never heard
of a boy like this before. "Dear me!" they
said. "If there were <em>no</em> fairies how could
there be any fairy stories? How stupid of
little George not to believe in us! We believe
in <em>him</em>, and he is only a boy and not a fairy
at all."</p>

<p>So Puck set to work to think what to do, and
went wandering through the woods, asking all
the birds, all the beasts, and even the insects if
they knew what to do with a boy called George
who didn't believe in the fairies. None of them
were able to help him. An old horned beetle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
said, "I should pinch him!" but Puck didn't
think that pinching was of much use.</p>

<p>When George went to bed, Puck used to sit
on his pillow and tell him the most beautiful
dreams, but George forgot all about them when
he woke up. What can one do with a boy like
that?</p>

<p>Nurse, however, just nodded her head wisely
and said: "Wait and see!" There are thousands
of nurses saying the same thing all over the
world. They just <em>know</em> what will happen later
on, and that is all. They never tell anyone else.
If they do they are not real nurses, and should
be given a month's notice.</p>

<p>George's nurse was what people called a 'comfortable'
person. She was big and round, and
her shoes creaked just now and again&mdash;quite a
lady-like creak. She did not often smile, but
when she did you felt sure the sun was shining
and that the world was a jolly place to live in.
Nurses&mdash;real nurses&mdash;know <em>everything</em>; very
likely they have been taught by the fairies, but
if you asked your nurse this question she would
never tell you. Oh no!</p>

<p>Nurse always spoke of Alexander as "that
black imp," but he knew how to coax a piece
of biscuit from her whenever he wished. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
used to sit down on the nursery hearth-rug
with his head on one side, thump gently
with his tail on the floor, and bark very
gently, "<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>" without stopping, for
ever so long.</p>

<p>It must be a grand thing to be a dog like
Alexander whenever one wants a biscuit.</p>

<p>George was very busy just now, for he had
made up his mind to be an aviator. An aviator
is a man who flies up in the air on a machine
which looks something like a large bird, and
makes a noise like ever so many cats quarrelling.
It flies straight up, and then before you can say
"Knife!" it is out of sight. There are no tunnels
or stations, no tickets such as you have on the
railway. You just go straight ahead until you
get there.</p>

<p>No wonder George didn't think about the
fairies when his head was full of such wonderful
things.</p>

<p>But Father said: "Time enough to fly when
you are grown up."</p>

<p>Mother said: "An aviator? <em>No</em>, George,
darling! You can come for a ride in the
carriage with me this afternoon."</p>

<p>And Nurse said&mdash;of course, the same as before.</p>

<p>And so the months and the years went by;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
George grew bigger, Alexander grew fatter,
Nurse grew more and more comfortable, and
Puck grew crosser and crosser. At last, one
day, everybody woke up and said: "George
Henry is eight years old to-morrow!"</p>

<p class="p6"><em>George Grows Up</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was not long before everybody knew all
about it. George was going to have a
party! Not an ordinary party, but a
splendid one. There were invitations for all
George's friends, both boys and girls; for
Grandfather, Grandmother, uncles, aunts, and
all kinds of grown-ups who could help to hand
round the tea and cakes and let off fireworks
when it grew dark.</p>

<p>George was quite ready to have the fireworks
first thing in the morning as soon as he woke
up; but Father said, "No!" Mother said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
"No!" and Nurse said nothing, but just <em>looked</em>.
Nurses don't like fireworks, though they sometimes
pretend they do.</p>

<p>Everybody&mdash;except Alexander&mdash;must have
been getting ready for this birthday for weeks
and weeks, for when George woke up a little
earlier than usual on the great day there was
quite a stir and bustle in the house. The postman
could hardly carry his bag along the path
up to the front door. It was packed full of
presents.</p>

<p>Alexander had a big red silk bow fastened
round his neck, and nearly fell all the way downstairs
through twisting his head round to try
and bite it off. Even Nurse, for once, almost
ran, she was in such a hurry.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful thing to have a birthday if
you have enough kind uncles and aunts to help.
Uncles must be strong enough to carry you on
their shoulders like a never-tiring horse, then to
change into bears which you can shoot at, and,
almost before they have finished dying under
the sofa, they must be ready to change into
anything else you may want.</p>

<p>Aunts are best when they smile all the time
and bring out sweets and chocolates from some
hidden part of their dresses, like conjurers, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
when you are tired and want to rest for a
minute. Alexander liked aunts, and was always
ready to beg for biscuits even when he met one
of them in the middle of the street or in a shop.
Uncles were all right, but rather tiring. Dogs
don't always want to play games.</p>

<p>Well, the number of presents was perfectly
delightful, and everybody had sent exactly what
George wanted. But in the middle of breakfast
he looked up suddenly and said: "It's Alexander's
birthday too. Hasn't <em>he</em> got any presents?"</p>

<p>"What?" said Father, turning quite red in
the face and forgetting that he was holding a
piece of bacon on the end of his fork.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mother, looking as if she
were going to cry. "Oh, where's Nurse?"</p>

<p>Nurse appeared in the room at once, and when
she heard that it was Alexander's birthday, do
you think that she said "What?" or "Dear
me?" Not at all.</p>

<p>She just went to the door and called:
"Alex&mdash;ander!"</p>

<p>Alexander arrived with a rush and a bang,
looking as if nothing in the world would ever
surprise <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>"Alexander," said Father solemnly, "I have
great pleasure in telling you that this is your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
birthday. I wish you many happy returns of
the day!"</p>

<p>"<em>Wuff!</em>" replied Alexander, wagging his
tail, and looking at Father as much as to say:
"Don't keep me waiting any longer. You know
how hungry I am!"</p>

<p>Father smiled, and suddenly in his hand he
held a most beautiful silver collar, on which was
written Alexander's name. He took off the red
bow and put the collar round Alexander's neck.
Alexander said nothing, but sat and waited.</p>

<p>Mother wished him 'many happy returns'
too, and then&mdash;where had she hidden it?&mdash;there
was a pretty tin of sugary biscuits with 'A'
printed on the top.</p>

<p>"<em>Wu&mdash;uff!</em>" said Alexander, and wagged his
tail so hard that he nearly fell over.</p>

<p>George looked quite pleased. "I'm so glad
he wasn't forgotten," he said; "it didn't seem
fair for me to get such lots of things, and
Alexander nothing at all."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was soon four o'clock, and the guests began
to arrive, first in ones and twos and then in
threes and fours.</p>

<p>It was a lovely summer day, and after games
in the garden there was a Punch and Judy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
which everybody liked, especially Father and
the uncles. Alexander sat quite still until
Punch's dog appeared, and then he had to be
led indoors and shut up, for he grew quite fierce,
and was just getting ready to bite Punch's nose off.</p>

<p>Punch without a nose wouldn't be a Punch at
all, and then the man who keeps him would never
be able to go to parties again. But Alexander
never thought about that.</p>

<p>By this time everybody was ready for tea,
which was served in a large tent in the garden.
On the middle of the table stood a very large
cake stuffed full of plums. Nurse had made
this with her own hands, and there were no
cakes like hers. One could eat two and even
three large-sized slices and scarcely feel a little
bit uncomfortable afterward.</p>

<p>No one could eat any of this cake, however,
until most of the white and brown bread and
butter&mdash;you were allowed to have jam spread
on it&mdash;scones, tea cakes, cream cakes, ice cakes,
jam puffs, tartlets, and oh! heaps of other
things had disappeared. Then Father stood up
with a large knife in his right hand, and made a
little speech. Everybody clapped their hands
and laughed&mdash;even the uncles and aunts who
had had no tea at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>George sat in a high chair looking as proud as
a king. Kings always look proud, and queens,
their wives, look proud too, but in quite a nice
way. If you have ever seen them riding by in
a carriage drawn by six white horses in gold
harness you will understand exactly why you
cannot <em>really</em> look proud in a cab with one horse,
or in a taxi-cab which flies along with a fizz and
a bang. You only just have time to get the
eighteenpence ready for the driver. If you
were a king you wouldn't ever have to do that.</p>

<p>After the speech George cut the cake and
Father helped, so that everybody, grown-ups
and all, had a slice.</p>

<p>Then George had to speak. "Thank you very
much," he said. "I hope you've enjoyed the
party. I know I have, and so has Alexander.
Now we're going to have the fireworks!"</p>

<p>It was not dark yet, so there were games and
races, followed by a little rest, during which
Mother told them stories. Then Uncle William,
the funny man of the party, gave an imitation
of all the animals in a farmyard, which was even
better than the real thing, of a railway train
coming out of a tunnel, and, last of all, of Father
getting up in the morning.</p>

<p>Father laughed so much at this that Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
had to pat him very hard on the back for several
minutes. Uncle William was not allowed to tell
the story of the two cats on the wall, because
Alexander did not like cats&mdash;even cats which
weren't real.</p>

<p>At last it was time for the fireworks, and all
the children seated themselves at one end of the
garden and waited patiently. Suddenly <em>bang!</em>
up went a red star, then a green one; then
showers and showers of little green ones. Then
<em>bang! bing! bang! fizz! crack!</em> jumped the
crackers. <em>Rrrrrrr!</em> whirled the Catherine
wheels, slowly at first, then fast, faster, and so
fast that they made your eyes quite sore watching
them.</p>

<p><em>Hiss! Whizz! Bang!</em> went a rocket with
a tail as long as from here to the end of the next
street. Higher and higher it flew, until, all of a
sudden, just as you thought it was quite out of
sight, it burst, and&mdash;ah!&mdash;hundreds of little stars
lit up the sky and made it look lighter than even
the lightest day.</p>

<p>But there was something better to come still.
At the end of the shrubbery a light shone faintly
and then went out. Then shone more and more
lights, until you could see that great big letters
as tall as yourself were growing up. And then&mdash;all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of a sudden&mdash;in a blaze of light there was
spelt out for all to see, G<span class="smcapa">EORGE</span>.</p>

<p>Such crackings and bangings, such shouts and
cheers from all over the garden you <em>never</em> heard,
nor anyone else either.</p>

<p>That was a <em>real</em> surprise.</p>

<p>Just as people were getting ready to put on
their coats and say "Thank you very much for
your delightful party," another light shone out
over the high tree near the garden gate.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Father. "Hullo, what's this?
A surprise from Uncle William, I expect," and
he stood still and watched.</p>

<p>Brighter and brighter grew the light, longer
and longer, until it looked like a great tongue of
fire. Then it swept along over the trees, under
the trees, in and out and round about, until it
looked as if thousands of little lanterns were
shining everywhere.</p>

<p>"It sounds as if there were music somewhere,
quite far off," said Mother. "Well, I don't
know what it can be."</p>

<p>Uncle William, who was supposed to know
all about it, said that he hadn't done it, but
nobody believed him.</p>

<p>Little by little the lights died out, and then
it was time to go home to bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>George was quite sleepy, and was very glad
to find his head resting on a soft pillow. After
he had said his prayers and said "Good-night,"
he called out to Nurse: "Do <em>you</em> know who
made those jolly little lights, right at the end
of the fireworks?"</p>

<p>Nurse stood silent for a moment: "Perhaps I
do; perhaps I don't," she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh," said George, "tell me, then!"</p>

<p>"Good-night, Master George." Out went the
light, and if George hadn't been so sleepy and
tired he might have found out all about it then
and there; but that would have meant that all
kinds of things which were just going to happen
wouldn't have happened at all, which would
have been a pity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Puck sat cross-legged on an old toadstool, and
the fairies danced all round him in their magic
ring.</p>

<p>"It <em>was</em> a jolly party!" he said to the old
frog. "You ought to have been there."</p>

<p>"<em>Ker-ek!</em>" replied the frog. "My throat was
rather sore to-night, so of course I could not go.
I hear there were fireworks."</p>

<p>All the fairies stopped dancing and burst out
laughing when they heard him say this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"What <em>are</em> you laughing at?" he croaked.</p>

<p>Puck jumped off his stool and turned head
over heels.</p>

<p>"Tell him! Tell him!" they all cried out.</p>

<p>"Well," said Puck, "<em>we</em> were all there. The
fairy music band played; the fire-flies and glow-worms
made beautiful fireworks, more beautiful
than the grown-ups had bought&mdash;and no one
knows who did it. What fun!"</p>

<p>"<em>Ugh!</em>" said the frog. "I don't see anything
to laugh at."</p>

<p>"Don't you?" said Puck. "Well, wait until
we have <em>our</em> party and invite George."</p>

<p>"He won't come," croaked the frog.</p>

<p>"Won't he?" replied Puck. "<em>Won't</em> he?"</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Midsummer Eve</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N a few days' time it would be Midsummer
Eve, and then the little fairies have a dance
and supper all to themselves. Very few
people have ever been there, and even fewer
know anything at all about it. Only the <em>very</em>
best people receive invitations, and, of course,
there are never very many of the best people in
the world.</p>

<p>It is very hard indeed to be good, but&mdash;oh
dear!&mdash;to be best! Why, it means being good,
and going on being good, until you are <em>so</em>
good that Mother thinks something must be
the matter with you and sends for the doctor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Anyway, the fairies sent George an invitation,
but he didn't understand what it meant, for it
was written on an oak leaf which Puck blew in
through the bedroom window. George thought
it was only a common leaf and never picked
it up.</p>

<p>"Well, has George answered his invitation
yet?" said the old frog to Puck a few days
before the dance.</p>

<p>"No," replied Puck, "he hasn't, but he's
coming."</p>

<p>"Coming, indeed!" croaked the frog, who
had just caught a worse cold than ever.
"Well, I'll believe it when I see him, and
not before."</p>

<p>"All right," said Puck. "You'd better go
home, or else you won't be able to come to the
party with that cold of yours."</p>

<p>There was such a bustling, a running about, a
flying here and a flying there in the wood all
day and all night getting ready for Midsummer
Eve. Such a brushing and combing, such a
sewing and darning, polishing and scrubbing,
and I don't know what else! Such a baking
and brewing, cooking, stewing, and such nice
smells! Puck carried bits of these away in his
pocket, and George had the most delightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
dreams of all the things he liked best to eat and
drink.</p>

<p>Nurse smiled when he told her, and Alexander
listened with his head a little on one side, hoping
to hear the word 'biscuit' or 'bone.' His idea
of a really good party was a pile of bones and
biscuits, with leave to eat them on the drawing-room
carpet. This is just as good fun as waiting
outside on the stairs for the jellies and creams
when there is a dinner-party at your house.</p>

<p>George had already forgotten about aeroplanes,
and was very proud of being in trousers.
When he first wore them he could not help
looking down almost every minute to see if they
were still there. The worst of wearing trousers
is that you have to be so careful. Dogs like
Alexander <em>will</em> jump and bump against them,
leaving dirty paw-marks, just when you are
not looking. Directly one begins to grow up
there are really such a number of things one
must think about.</p>

<p>George used to stand with his legs wide apart
and his hands in his pockets like Father, until
Nurse sewed the pockets up tight one night
when he was fast asleep. Trousers without
pockets are like jam tarts without jam.</p>

<p>George said nothing when he found it out, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
in the garden after breakfast he remarked to
Alexander: "When I grow up&mdash;<em>really</em> grow up&mdash;I
am going to have pockets all over me, just
as many as ever you can imagine. There will
be so many that no one will ever be able to sew
them up again."</p>

<p>Alexander nodded. After all, he might be
able to keep his bones in a suit with as many
pockets as that!</p>

<p>Midsummer Eve came at last. Everything
was ready in the wood; even the old frog's cold
was better, though he was still rather hoarse.
The fairy ring was as smooth as velvet, and the
fairy band had learned quite a number of new
tunes.</p>

<p>Puck was as busy as he could be, and whenever
there was a moment to spare he brought
another piece of moss for the seat which he had
been making for George. It was right in the
middle of the wood in a little open space with
high trees all round it. Whenever the wind
came the trees rustled softly, and it sounded
just as if they were putting their heads together
and whispering secrets. Most of these trees
were very old; so old that they had grown quite
bent, and their long, twisted boughs hung down
almost to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>On Midsummer Eve the moon always shines
brightly, and lights up the fairy ring with a soft,
silvery light. No one knows whether Puck asks
her to do it, but if you will look out of your
window&mdash;if you can wake up at the right
moment&mdash;you will see for yourself that it is
quite true, for so many of the best things always
happen while we are fast asleep in bed.</p>

<p>George went to bed as usual. Alexander
flopped down on the mat outside the door and
curled himself up. One by one the lights in
the house went out, and soon everybody was
fast asleep. It was as still as still can be.</p>

<p>Far, far off sounded the first notes of the fairy
music. Alexander pricked up one ear for a
second, then sighed and fell fast asleep again.</p>

<p>George turned over in his bed and began to
snore. Puck flew in through the half-open
window and rested for a moment on his pillow.</p>

<p>"It's all ready, George," he whispered.
"We're only waiting for you!"</p>

<p>George snored a little louder.</p>

<p>"George!" cried Puck, "George, come along!
Don't be late!"</p>

<p>George was dreaming. He was dreaming
that he was in school saying the multiplication
table, twice times, three times, and some of four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
times. He actually wasn't thinking about the
fairies at all!</p>

<p>Puck sat for a moment thinking what he
should do; then he flew out through the window
and back to the wood.</p>

<p>The multiplication table, indeed! No one
ever thinks of such things on Midsummer Eve.
It is a time to dream of dancing, music, light,
laughter, the wind in the trees, the <em>tinkle, tinkle</em>
of water in the little brooks, the song of birds&mdash;they
are all awake then&mdash;of almost anything
else, but <em>not</em> twice times two.</p>

<p>The fairies were just beginning to dance when
Puck flew into the middle of the ring, and he
looked so angry that they all stopped, wondering
what could have happened.</p>

<p>He could say nothing at first but "twice
times four is ten," which is nonsense, but he had
never learned his tables and never wanted to.
He said this over and over again, just as if it
were a rhyme, and they all listened, though they
did not understand a bit what it meant.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" said the old frog, who was sitting
there puffing himself out as if he were trying to
turn himself into a toy balloon. "Oh, ho! I see
what it is. George won't come after all. I told
you so. Oh, ho! Oh, ho!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"For shame!" all the fairies cried out. "For
shame! Nasty old thing! You're quite glad
he isn't coming."</p>

<p>Puck sat with his head in his hands, thinking
and whispering to himself, "Three times four
are seven," which was worse than ever.</p>

<p>The fairies felt <em>so</em> sorry for him. They all
came and sat round him in a ring with their
little heads in their hands. They did not
know why he was doing this, but they did
it to cheer him up. The old frog sat puffing,
just as if some one had wound him up like a
clockwork toy and he wasn't able to stop.</p>

<p>After a long time Puck looked up and said:
"Well, it's no use waiting. He won't come
to-night."</p>

<p>The old frog was so pleased when he heard
this that he opened his mouth to say "I told
you so," but he had puffed himself out to
such a size that he fell over backward
suddenly into a pool with a great splash,
and never spoke another word for the rest
of the evening.</p>

<p>"No, he won't come," said Puck, "it's no
use waiting. I always thought he would learn
to believe in us after a time, but he won't, he
<em>won't!</em>" And he spun himself round on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
leg like lightning a hundred times without
stopping. He was really angry!</p>

<p>The fairies all spun themselves round on one
leg too, but this made them so dizzy that
they fell over one another in heaps, and for
a few minutes they really didn't know whether
they were on their heads or their heels. At
last they were all right side up again,
wondering what it was all about.</p>

<p>"Let's go on with the dance now!" cried
Puck. "I'll tell you all about it to-morrow."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fairy music began again; the fairies
danced round the ring, and all the animals in
the wood came out to watch them. The moon
looked on with a smile; she was always
very fond of the fairies, and never minded
shining a little longer than usual if the fairies
wanted to go on dancing.</p>

<p>At midnight they were ready for supper.
First of all they had&mdash;but wait a bit!&mdash;it is
not time to tell you about that yet, with
George snoring away in bed, and saying his
tables over and over to himself.</p>

<p>After supper they danced again, and acted
a little play in which they pretended to be
grown-up people at a party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>One fairy pretended to be Alexander, and
barked "<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>" so like him that all
the rabbits ran back into their holes in a
fright. It was delightful to hear the tinkle
of the fairy laughter.</p>

<p>If you strike a glass very, <em>very</em> softly with
a spoon several times, that sounds something
like a fairy laughing&mdash;but not quite.</p>

<p>Puck had forgotten about George now, and
was enjoying himself as much as the rest of
them. He pretended that he was an aeroplane,
and flew round and round until he
looked as if he would fly away for good.</p>

<p>Then he turned head over heels ever so
many times until you could hardly see him.
Then he pretended to be the old frog, "<em>Oh, ho!
Oh, ho!</em>" and puffed himself out and coughed
until the fairies nearly died of laughing.</p>

<p>By and by the moon began to disappear
behind a cloud. This was her polite way of
saying that it was time for her to go to bed,
because the sun was just getting up.</p>

<p>The party was at an end; and soon over
the top of the hill peeped the sun, very red
in the face, ready to begin his day's work.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Dream-Music</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">W</span>HETHER it was the cakes or the
fireworks, no one ever knew. Father
said that it must have been the
cakes. Nurse thought it was the fireworks.
The doctor, who came in a little motor-car
with just room for himself inside, shook his
head and looked very solemn.</p>

<p>George was not well and was kept in bed.
The doctor sent a large bottle of medicine,
and Nurse shook the bottle very hard before
giving George two large tablespoonfuls.
Alexander sat at the end of the bed and
looked on. Perhaps he thought he ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
have some medicine too, for he was always
ready to taste anything, and even a tin of boot
polish didn't seem to disagree with him. There
were very few things that he hadn't tasted.</p>

<p>The doctor came every morning for four
days, and every morning his little motor
<em>puff-puffed</em> outside the garden gate whilst
he went upstairs into the bedroom where
George was, and said: "Well, and how are
we this morning? A little better, eh?"</p>

<p>But George always said that he felt a little
worse, and wanted to get up and go out for
a walk with Alexander. He was cross with
everybody, and at last Mother thought he
must be really ill.</p>

<p>She sat by his bed and read stories to him;
sometimes he listened, and sometimes he just
kicked his legs about in bed and said: "Oh,
<em>do</em> let me get up. I hate being in bed."</p>

<p>"You <em>must</em> be good, George dear," said
Mother, "or else you will never get well."</p>

<p>It was no good. George wouldn't even
listen to Nurse now, so it was not a bit of
use talking.</p>

<p>He wouldn't take his medicine; he wouldn't
lie quiet. He did everything he ought not to
do. Even Alexander looked as if he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
like to cry, and never once wagged his tail.
This showed how sorry he felt for himself and
for everybody else.</p>

<p>At last George was so tired that, as it was
growing dark, he fell asleep. Nurse sat by
the side of his bed with a large pair of spectacles
on, knitting a pair of stockings.</p>

<p>As fast as she knitted stockings for George
he wore them out, but she didn't seem to
mind. What the boys do who haven't got
nurses it is difficult to say. Think of all the
stockings there must be in the world with
holes in their heels and toes and knees!
It was quite quiet. Nurse sat as still as
still could be; if her fingers hadn't been
moving all the time you would have thought
she was fast asleep.</p>

<p>It grew darker and darker, until at last the
moon came out from behind a cloud and shone
through the window. It was just the kind of
night on which the fairies love to be dancing in
the wood. Perhaps they were.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"What a splendid sleep you've had, darling,"
said Mother, as she kissed George next morning.</p>

<p>George sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes.
"I've had <em>such</em> a dream!" he began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Won't you tell me all about it?" asked
Mother.</p>

<p>George thought for a long time, then shook
his head. "It's all gone again," he said. "I
can only just remember that I went for a long
walk with Alexander, and we came to such a
wonderful place. I think I met Nurse there,
but she looked quite different ... and yet she
was just the same."</p>

<p>Nurse smiled.</p>

<p>"Were you really there?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied. "Now it's time for
your medicine."</p>

<p>By the time he had finished his medicine
George had forgotten about the dream, but he
kept remembering it in bits all day long.</p>

<p>Alexander looked delighted when George was
allowed to get up and come into the garden.
Perhaps he knew all about the dream, for he
would often stop when he was digging up a
bone, and look as if he were trying to remember
something.</p>

<p>Dogs have splendid dreams sometimes.
When they give short little barks in their sleep
they must be chasing cats. But what do cats
dream about?</p>

<p>The doctor did not look at all solemn to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
He sat in the garden and talked to George
about motor-cars and aeroplanes. But George
was all the time trying to remember his dream,
and told the doctor little bits of it whenever he
remembered.</p>

<p>"Do you believe in fairies?" George asked the
doctor suddenly.</p>

<p>"Fairies?" said the doctor. "Well, <em>you</em>
believe in them, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied George. "I think
my dream last night was about fairies, but they
weren't very like the fairies in the books I read.
Is there a <em>real</em> Fairyland?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see," replied the doctor, looking
very solemn again, "you really ought to go
there and find out."</p>

<p>"But <em>how</em> can I find out," asked George, "if I
don't know whether there is a Fairyland or not?
How can I find the way there?"</p>

<p>The doctor scratched his head. "Well, I
expect Nurse or Mother will tell you all about
it," he said.</p>

<p>"Nurse always answers, 'Perhaps there is and
perhaps there isn't.' I don't believe any of you
really know at all," cried George.</p>

<p>The doctor shook his head, looked as if he
were going to say something, then smiled and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
said: "Perhaps!&mdash;that's just what we've all
got to find out about a great many things,
George. If you really want to find the way
there, I expect you will. Only you must wish
hard, as hard as ever you can!" and with a
laugh he went down the garden path, stepped
into his motor, and <em>puff-puffed</em> away.</p>

<p>"I don't believe there are any fairies," said
George, with a stamp of his foot. "It's just
silly nonsense, and they only say that there are
fairies to tease me."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Puck was sitting on a toadstool watching the
little fairies, who were having a flying race.
They flew round and round and up and down,
and the colours of their little wings were as
beautiful as the most beautiful rainbow. Maybe
the rainbow is made out of fairies' wings.</p>

<p>When they were tired they all fluttered down
to the ground again and sat down on the grass
in a ring. They love to sit like this, because
most of the good games are played when one
sits round in a ring. The fairies are never
tired of playing games. Even their work is
play to them, and so they never need to go to
school.</p>

<p>No one ever heard of a fairy schoolmaster or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
schoolmistress. If there were such people, they
would be playing all the time, and so they
couldn't possibly be teachers.</p>

<p>They had forgotten all about George, for they
really believed by now that there was not a boy
of that name at all. When grown-up people
forget about the fairies, is it because they
are getting old and thinking about what they
should eat and drink, and what clothes they
should wear? The fairies know that grown-ups
do these silly things, and don't mind, but
children ought to know better. The fairies
were not playing a game just then. They were
listening to Puck, who was telling them a story.
It is hard to guess what the story was about,
for the fairies do not have fairy stories. What
seems so wonderful to us is only what happens
to them every day, and so whoever tells a story
in Fairyland must think of something quite
different.</p>

<p>They enjoyed the story very much, for they
laughed and clapped their hands, and even the
old frog forgot his cold.</p>

<p>"To-night! To-night!" they all cried when
Puck had finished, and then they all danced
round and round so fast that it would have hurt
your eyes to look at them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>The moon shone more brightly than ever that
night. The sky was covered with bright,
twinkling stars, and a soft, warm breeze rustled
through the tops of the trees in the wood.</p>

<p>George would have loved to go for a walk, but
he was tucked up safely in bed, and Alexander
was lying on the mat outside his door. Nurse
had left him alone for some time, and he couldn't
get to sleep. He wanted to dream again and
go back to that wonderful country of which he
remembered so little.</p>

<p>He tossed about on his pillow, wishing that he
were outside in the garden or anywhere except
in bed. He could hear the old clock outside on
the landing, <em>tick, tock, tick, tock</em>, and now and
again Alexander gave a little bark which showed
that he was fast asleep and dreaming.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard another sound. It seemed
to be far off, but little by little it sounded nearer
and nearer.</p>

<p>"It's just as if somebody were blowing little
trumpets," thought George to himself. "I
wonder where it can be?"</p>

<p>The sound of the music floated in the air, died
away, and then, more sweetly than ever, echoed
and echoed until it seemed as if it might indeed
be fairy music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"I must get up and see what it is," said
George. "It might be soldiers, though they
don't seem to have a drum."</p>

<p>He jumped quickly out of bed and went to
the window. There was nothing to be seen, not
even a shadow on the lawn.</p>

<p>"That's very queer," thought George. "I
wonder that Alexander hasn't heard it."</p>

<p>After waiting for a few minutes he got back
into bed, and scarcely had he laid his head on
the pillow when far, far away sounded the fairy
music.</p>

<p>"Lovely! Lovely!" murmured George. "It
must come from that country I dreamed about
last night."</p>

<p class="p6"><em>The Land of Dreams</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was still, so still in the wood that you
could have heard a pin drop. One doesn't
usually drop pins in a wood, but on the
floor, or on a chair, or somewhere else where
they are sure to run into you just when you
are not expecting anything of the kind.</p>

<p>There was not a breath of wind; the
trees, standing in rows like giant sentinels,
seemed to be waiting for somebody. Who could
it be?</p>

<p>A lovely path of soft green moss ran through
this wood from one end of it to the other.
Far away one could see a little patch of blue.
This was the sky. The trees were so high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
that they formed a roof overhead and shut
out nearly all the light.</p>

<p>By and by there was a joyful bark, and
dashing through the wood came a black dog
with his tail waving behind him. It was
Alexander! He <em>was</em> enjoying himself.</p>
<p>George came hurrying along after him.
Though he had been running for quite a
long time he didn't seem to be a little bit tired.
His cheeks were rosy, his eyes were bright,
and he sang aloud for joy. He was so glad
to be out with Alexander once more.</p>

<p>"Wait for me, Alexander!" he cried. "Wait
for me. Don't be in such a hurry!"</p>

<p>Alexander came bounding toward him, and
after chasing one another in and out of among
the trees they threw themselves down on the soft
moss to rest for a moment.</p>

<p>"I think I should like to lie here all day,"
said George. "I don't remember coming to
this part of the wood before. I wonder how
we got here. Do you know, Alexander?"</p>

<p>"I brought you here, little George," said
Alexander&mdash;at least, it sounded as if he had
said that, and for a moment George thought
he had really spoken.</p>

<p>"That would be fun," he thought to himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
as he lay back with his head against the
trunk of a tree. "What would they say if
I went home and said that Alexander had
been talking to me?"</p>

<p>Suddenly, far, far off he heard the music
again. It seemed to be calling, calling to
him: "Come, little boy, come and dance
and play! The sun is shining; the soft wind
is blowing. Come and play with us!"</p>

<p>"What nonsense!" said George aloud. "I
must be dreaming again. I wonder if the
doctor gave me that medicine to make me
dream. What was it he said to me about
Fairyland?"</p>

<p>"Wish as hard as ever you can!" said
Alexander.</p>

<p>George was so startled when he heard
Alexander speak for the second time that
he fell down backward. Then he sat up
slowly and looked at him. The dear black
dog was sitting up, looking at George with&mdash;yes!&mdash;a
<em>smile</em> on his face, and wagging his
tail gently to and fro.</p>

<p>"Now am I dreaming or not?" said
George.</p>

<p>Alexander still smiled and wagged his tail,
but he said never a word this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come on!" cried George, and he ran down
the path as hard as ever he could.</p>

<p>He ran and ran until suddenly he found
himself right out of the wood and in the midst
of a most beautiful meadow. A little stream
of clear blue water flowed gently along past
banks carpeted with flowers. There must have
been hundreds of them, and every one a different
colour.</p>

<p>The sun was shining as he had never seen it
shine before, and yet he did not feel a bit too
hot.</p>

<p>He looked around him, but there was no one
to be seen. The only sound was the soft <em>gurgle,
gurgle</em> of the stream flowing over the stones.
He lay down by the side of it, and hollowing
his hands to make a cup, dipped them in the
water; then, raising them to his mouth, took a
deep, delicious drink.</p>

<p>George drank again and yet again; then,
lying face downward, gazed into the stream.
It was full of little fishes; golden, silver&mdash;there
were so many that he could not even count
them, and each was more beautiful than the
other.</p>

<p>"This is jolly!" he thought. "It's just like a
piece out of a story, only better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose to his feet and stood for a moment
thinking. "I know; I want to cross the
stream," he said, when&mdash;lo and behold!&mdash;just in
front of him there was a little bridge, exactly
wide enough for one person at a time. He
crossed it with Alexander at his heels; then,
turning round to look back, found that the
bridge had vanished!</p>

<p>This was a curious thing to happen, but
George hadn't time to wait. He wanted to go
on and on and find out where the wonderful
music came from.</p>

<p>"<em>Wu-uff!</em>" barked Alexander, and it sounded
for all the world as if he were saying: "What
fun, George! What fun!"</p>

<p>On they dashed, first George in front and
then his dog. Right across the meadow
they went, and suddenly found themselves
on a broad white road which went winding
and winding along as far as ever you could
see.</p>

<p>"This is like 'Over the hills and far away,'"
laughed George. "Come on, old boy!" And
on they ran again, so fast that the road looked
as if it were unwinding itself quickly like a ball
of ribbon.</p>

<p>"I expect we shall soon get there now," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
George. "We must be miles and miles away
from home."</p>

<p>The road grew narrower and narrower until
it became quite a little path, and this path led
them up to a little green gate, which appeared
suddenly in front of them as if it had popped up
out of the ground.</p>

<p>"This must lead to just where I want to
go," said George. He was quite accustomed to
talking aloud now. Somehow his voice sounded
different, and he felt as if he <em>must</em> talk, for it
seemed as if some one&mdash;he didn't know who&mdash;was
listening to him all the time.</p>

<p>Across the top of the gate was written in
shining letters "<em>Please open me.</em>"</p>

<p>George pushed it open and walked through;
then he saw that on the other side was "<em>Please
shut me.</em>" He shut it carefully behind him and
walked on.</p>

<p>Once more, in front of him, sounded the music,
but clearer and louder, as if it were only round
the corner&mdash;but there was no corner.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mtop1 illowe43" src="images/i_070.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THERE STOOD A DELIGHTFUL LITTLE HOUSE</p></div>
</div>

<p>He found himself in a narrow, shady glade.
The trees, the grass, everything was a cool,
delicious green. It was like looking down
a long tunnel lighted by a soft green light.
The little path went straight down-hill as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
far as one could see, and never seemed to
end.</p>

<p>George was beginning to wonder where he
was going to, and if he had not wanted to
find out about the music he would have
turned back, for it felt like tea-time. He
could not remember at what hour he had
started out; nor how he had got into the
wood; nor did he know how he was going
to find his way back. But he knew that it
was close upon tea-time, which is quite a
different feeling from breakfast and lunch-time,
as you all know.</p>

<p>"I wish there was a house here," he
thought. "I should like tea with plenty of
jam and cake."</p>

<p>There was really no end to the surprises
of this most wonderful day. The path went
straight&mdash;as if it had been told&mdash;into a
wide open space, and there stood a delightful
little house with smoke curling up from its
chimneys.</p>

<p>George stood still for a moment and looked
at it with eyes wide open in surprise. Alexander
rushed forward, barking joyfully, and
jumped against the door.</p>

<p>George followed him, and then stood still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
again, for painted on the door in tiny letters
was G<span class="smcapa">EORGE'S</span> H<span class="smcapa">OUSE</span>.</p>

<p>"How funny!" he thought. "There must
be another George living here. I hope he
will be kind and give me tea."</p>

<p>He lifted the latch and walked inside. There
was no one there, but in the middle of the
most comfortable little room stood a table
with the cloth laid; tea, bread and butter,
cake, jam (two kinds)&mdash;quite a birthday tea,
in fact.</p>

<p>Alexander was already seated in one of the
chairs as if he were in the nursery at home
and eager to begin.</p>

<p>"Well!" said George, "this <em>is</em> nice!" And
before you could count 'two' he had seated
himself at the table, poured out a cup of tea,
and was spreading strawberry jam on to a
large piece of fresh bread and butter. How
they both enjoyed themselves! There never
was such a tea!</p>

<p>When they had eaten all they could there was
still plenty left on the table. It almost looked
as if some one had been cutting bread and
butter and cake for them all the time.</p>

<p>George remembered to say his grace, and
then, all of a sudden, he felt very sleepy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's not nearly bed-time yet, but I wonder
if there's a bedroom. I should like to lie down
just for a minute or two," he said. Alexander
yawned and stretched himself.</p>

<p>George looked round, and there in the corner
he saw a stair, so up he went and found himself
in a little bedroom. The bed looked so
comfortable that he lay down on it, while
Alexander curled himself up at the foot with
a sigh of content.</p>

<p>The wind blew gently in through the window,
bringing with it the scent of sweet flowers.
Really it was just like asking George to go to
sleep.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes, and in a moment was
far away in the Land of Dreams.</p>

<p>Once more was heard the strain of music,
sweet and clear, and with it, wafted on the
wings of the wind, came the sound of hundreds
of tiny little voices laughing.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Father Time</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">G</span>EORGE dreamed that night as he had
never dreamed before. It was a curious
dream, full of dragons, giants, fairies,
aeroplanes, motor-cars, all mixed up together.
But all the time he half remembered where he
was and kept thinking: "I am in bed in the
little house that belongs to George, and it
must be a dream-house. If it is, then I am
dreaming inside a dream."</p>

<p>Every time he thought this he woke up&mdash;or
seemed to wake up&mdash;and then fell asleep again.
Alexander dreamed about large bones and
crackly biscuits. That was the kind of dream
he liked best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>Morning came&mdash;but perhaps there had never
been any night&mdash;and George really awoke, sat
up, and rubbed his eyes. The sun was shining
through the window, and Alexander had gone.</p>

<p>He washed his face and hands and went
downstairs. The table was laid for breakfast
with porridge and cream&mdash;a jug full!&mdash;eggs and
bacon, toast, rolls hot from the oven, fresh
butter, jam, and marmalade.</p>

<p>The Mr George who lived in this house <em>was</em>
a nice person to know. George felt that he
would like to stay here for quite a long time if
he could only send a message to Mother and let
her know where he was.</p>

<p>He sat down feeling quite delighted at having
breakfast all by himself, and just as he was
drinking his second cup of tea the door opened
and in came Alexander.</p>

<p>"Oh, where have you been?" cried George.
"Don't you want any breakfast?"</p>

<p>"<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>" replied Alexander, which
meant: "Don't ask me silly questions like that,
but give me something to eat."</p>

<p>He ate a good breakfast and drank a whole
saucerful of milk, which he hardly ever got at
home.</p>

<p>After breakfast George thought it was time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to start again. He had quite forgotten about
going home now. It seemed quite the right
thing to put on his cap and set off again to&mdash;where,
goodness only knows!</p>

<p>Alexander stood waiting by the door, and
George said aloud: "Thank you, Mr George,
for your kindness," just to show that he hadn't
forgotten his manners; then they went out into
the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>George's House stood in a lovely little spot.
Birds called to one another from the branches
of the high trees; rabbits scuttled in and out
of their holes, played hide-and-seek, and even
flopped just under Alexander's nose.</p>

<p>George took a deep breath: "Oh, I am
enjoying myself," he cried. "Aren't you,
Alexander?"</p>

<p>"Ra-ther!" barked Alexander, and ran round
and round chasing his tail while all the rabbits
sat and watched him. It certainly did seem as
if he had spoken that time&mdash;but no!&mdash;it wasn't
possible!</p>

<p>Off they went again. There were sure to be
more adventures if one only kept on and on to
the end of the wood. Little paths ran in all
directions, and each one looked greener and
nicer than the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"I expect they all go to the same place in the
end," said George, and so, without waiting for a
moment, he ran as hard as he could down the
nearest at hand. It twisted and turned in all
directions; sometimes it seemed as if it were
turning round and coming all the way back
again. At last it gave quite a little jump and
went straight ahead.</p>

<p>They walked and ran, and ran and walked by
turns; it grew lighter and lighter until they
could see the sun shining on the&mdash;yes, it was!&mdash;the
sea.</p>

<p>Now, if there is one place which is jollier
than all the others it is the seashore on a
sunny day. There is always paddling, bathing,
digging, making castles and lakes;
besides, the fun of getting caught by a
splashy wave is worth while getting wet twice
over.</p>

<p>Hurrah for the sea! You could almost hear
it calling, for in the summer-time all the little
boy-waves love to play with their friends the
human boys. Dogs are welcome too if they will
swim in after sticks.</p>

<p>In another moment George and Alexander
were out of the wood and on the seashore.
Such miles of hard yellow sand as far as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
could see, and a sea as blue, or even bluer
than the sky.</p>

<p>Off came George's clothes, and in he splashed
with Alexander after him. The water was as
warm as toast, and made him feel like having
five minutes more every time he thought of
coming out.</p>

<p>George dried himself in the sun and put on
his clothes, while Alexander rolled about in
the sand and shook himself until he looked
like a great mop with all its hair on end.
But after a bathe there are usually biscuits,
and there were certainly none here.</p>

<p>"I expect we shall find some," said George.
"If we don't, we must go back to George's
House and have dinner."</p>

<p>He turned to walk up the beach toward the
long sand-hills which ran in a line along the
shore, and there, sitting not far off him, he
saw an old man. This old man had white
hair, not very much of it, and a long beard
which flowed down to his knees. He was
holding something in his hand; George could
not see what it was.</p>

<p>"Perhaps he's lost his way. Come on, Alexander;
we'll go and ask him," said George.</p>

<p>He was quite a nice old man, and smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
such a kind smile when George took off his cap
politely and said: "Good-morning."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, little George," he answered.</p>

<p>"I say, do you know my name?" asked George
in surprise. "Oh, are you the Mr George who
lives in that little house in the wood, because
I slept there. This is Alexander, my
dog; he was there with me. He's a very
well-behaved dog unless he sees a cat or a
rabbit, and then it's an awful bother to get
him back. Have you got a dog? And what is
that thing you have in your hand? Oh, I forgot
I was never to ask more than one question
at a time. I am very sorry I was rude."</p>

<p>The old man smiled again. "No, my name
is not George. The little house belongs to&mdash;well,
you will find that out by and by. I
haven't a dog of my own, but I know all
about dogs. This is an hour-glass. It tells
the time. You see the sand trickling down
from one glass into the other. When all the
sand has trickled through I turn the glass
over, and it begins all over again."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, how jolly!" cried George. "May
I look? I've seen an hour-glass in a picture-book
I have at home, but this is a real one,
isn't it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite real," answered the old man; "as
real as you are, little George."</p>

<p>George gazed at the hour-glass for some
time; then suddenly he remembered something.
"Why, I know who is holding the hour-glass
in the picture," he said. "It's Father Time....
Oh, you look just like him! Are you Father
Time, please?"</p>

<p>"Well, that is what people call me," said
Father Time, stroking his long beard and
looking at George with a queer look, as if
he were trying to see right inside him.</p>

<p>"Then you can <em>really</em> fly?" asked George.
"Nurse always says that 'Time flies.' I don't
see your wings ... but perhaps you don't
need any," he added politely.</p>

<p>Father Time smiled very kindly, and spoke
in a very soft, gentle voice: "Yes, I fly, and
I have wings, though you cannot see them.
The young people think that I fly far too
slowly, and when they are grown up they
think I fly too quickly.... But the sand in
my hour-glass is always falling, falling, never
quickly, never slowly."</p>

<p>"And do you have to look after all the clocks
in the world?" asked George. "There are
ever so many. We've got six in our house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and Father and Mother have got watches
as well."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Father Time. "It gives me a
great deal of work, but if it were not for me you
wouldn't have any clocks and watches."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be queer!" exclaimed George.
"We should never know if it was time to go to
bed or time to get up. Nurse wouldn't like
that, for she loves everything to be 'on the tick,'
she says. 'A stitch in time saves nine' is what
she is always telling me."</p>

<p>"A great many people say that," answered
Father Time. "If everybody remembered it,
my old cloak wouldn't be as ragged as it is,"
and he showed George a number of holes and
tears which certainly looked as if they needed
mending.</p>

<p>Alexander whined and then barked: "Come
on, don't talk so much, please!"</p>

<p>"Down, Alexander!" cried George. "We're
going in a minute. Oh, please, can you tell me
the way to&mdash;&mdash;" And then he stopped, for he
really didn't know where he wanted to go to.</p>

<p>"You had better go up the road over there,"
said Father Time, pointing. "You will find a
finger-post which will show you the way. You
can't miss it; it is quite easy to find. Good-bye!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, wait a minute!" cried George, for old
Time was already some way off. He turned and
waved his hand.</p>

<p>"Time waits for no man!" he said. "Follow
your fortune, little George!"</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em> a funny old man," thought George.
"Follow my fortune? Whatever does he mean?"</p>

<p>Far, far off, he heard the sweet music once
again. It sounded more inviting than ever.
"It's like the story of Dick Whittington, only
he had a cat and not a dog. I believe the music
is saying: 'Follow your fortune, your fortune,
oh, follow!' Come and look for the finger-post,
Alexander!" And he ran up the sands toward
the road.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Puck flew into the wood. "He's here!" he
cried.</p>

<p>The fairies danced round him in delight.
"Hurrah!" they cried. "Hurrah!" sounds
different altogether and much nicer in their
language. "Tell us all about it!"</p>

<p>So Puck sat down and told them all about
George's adventures right from the beginning.
If you have not remembered everything you
must turn back and read it all again for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>Ker-ek!</em>" croaked the old frog. "But what's
all this about Father Time? How do you know
he met Time. I don't believe it!" and then he
nearly fell backward in surprise, for there stood
the old man in front of him.</p>

<p>"Now do you believe?" said Puck's voice, and
the fairies burst out laughing, for it was Puck
himself all the time!</p>

<p>When the old frog had stopped coughing
Father Time had disappeared, and Puck sat
there smiling.</p>

<p>"What a clever Puck I am!" he cried, turning
head over heels.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>More Adventures</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T really was a delightful country to live in.
There was no need to ask your way to
anywhere&mdash;you just went. Almost before
he knew where he was George found himself
back in front of the little house.</p>

<p>Smoke was still curling up from the chimneys,
so somebody must have been putting
more coal on the fire&mdash;at least, it would seem so.</p>

<p>It was quite time for dinner; and, sure
enough, dinner was ready. It doesn't matter
what George had to eat&mdash;it would make you
feel both hungry and cross if you knew.</p>

<p>When the meal was over George thought it
was quite time to follow his fortune, but
where and what was it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Alexander shall show me the way,"
he said, and he stepped outside into the
garden, where that always hungry creature
was cracking a large bone.</p>

<p>"Alexander, I mean to follow my fortune,"
he said, "but I don't know where it is. Can
you help me?"</p>

<p>To his surprise, Alexander looked up, wagged
his tail, and then said quite as plain as could
be: "All right; let me finish this bone and
then I'll come!"</p>

<p>George stared at him. "Can you <em>really</em>
talk, Alexander?"</p>

<p>"Talk? Of course I can talk," he replied.
"Who ever heard of a dog who couldn't talk?
I've talked to you ever since I've known you,
only I don't talk like a boy. I talk like a dog."</p>

<p>This was quite true, for he still had a
'doggy' voice, and there was a sound of
"<em>Wuff, wuff!</em>" in everything he said.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried George. "I never
knew you were talking. I thought you were
only barking."</p>

<p>"Well, barking <em>is</em> talking. What would be
the use of my barking if it meant nothing?"
replied Alexander rather crossly, for he hated
to be interrupted in the middle of a meal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
"Sit down a minute and then I shall be
ready."</p>

<p>George sat down and waited quietly. It
was quite still everywhere; there was a
soft little breeze which was just enough to
set the flowers in the garden nodding their
heads. It kissed George gently on the cheek,
and then gave a puff which made the golden
weathercock on the roof-top turn round and
round until it must have become giddy.</p>

<p>"Now I'm ready," said Alexander, licking his
lips and brushing his whiskers carefully, in case
there might still be a fragment left of his meal.</p>

<p>"Alexander, can you tell me whose house
this is?" George asked.</p>

<p>"Whose house?" said Alexander. "Why,
<em>you</em> know. It's written on the door."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that; but who is this Mr
George?"</p>

<p>"You are, of course," laughed Alexander,
and gave a jump of delight. "You are!
Fancy not knowing that it was your own
house! Ha, ha! What fun!" and he began
running after his own tail, faster and faster,
until he looked like a black Catherine wheel.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" cried George. "<em>My</em> house!
Oh, I wish I could bring Father and Mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to see it. Can't I send them an invitation to
tea? But I don't see a letter-box anywhere,
and I can't write a proper letter. Can you?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied Alexander. "I don't want
to. I don't know why people want to write
letters at all when they can go for walks and
talk to one another&mdash;and have games and
meals," he added.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I must just tell them all about it
when we get back again. Now we had better
start for&mdash;you know, wherever my fortune is."</p>

<p>Alexander looked round him for a moment.
"I think I know the way, but we may as well
ask the weathercock, so as to be quite sure."</p>

<p>"Ask the weathercock? How can that help
us?" George was becoming quite puzzled.</p>

<p>Alexander said nothing, but gave a short,
sharp bark. There was a faint "<em>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</em>"
from the roof in reply; then&mdash;could
George believe his eyes?&mdash;the golden
cock stepped off his little perch and fluttered
down to their feet.</p>

<p>He <em>was</em> a smart little bird! All gold from the
comb on his head to the spurs on his feet, and
he twinkled and shone so in the sunshine that
he was quite dazzling to look at. He flapped
his wings, pecked Alexander playfully behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the ear, and then crowed: "<em>Cock-a-doodle-doo-oo-oo!</em>"
and it sounded for all the world
as if he were saying: "How do you do-oo-oo?"</p>

<p>"George is going to follow his fortune," said
Alexander. "Can you put us on the right
road?"</p>

<p>"I'd better come with you for part of the
way," replied the weathercock. "It's just along
down there."</p>

<p>"How do you know the way so well, please?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"I know the way to everywhere. A brother
of mine stands on the roof of your home.
Haven't you ever seen him point?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said George; "I've often stood
and watched him turning round and round."</p>

<p>"Well, you don't suppose he's doing that for
fun, do you?" asked the cock, looking at him
with a bright and shining red eye. "He's
pointing out the way."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well, he's pointing out the way to <em>there</em>....
Every one wants to go there, some time or other.
If <em>you</em> don't want to go, why did you ask me?"</p>

<p>"Come along!" said Alexander. "George
will understand by and by. He's a stranger
here, you know."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>The weathercock strutted on ahead of them,
and George and Alexander followed.</p>

<p>"<em>He</em> can talk too," said George. "Everybody
seems able to talk here."</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Alexander. "Why
shouldn't they? Everything and everybody
talks in its own way if you only know how to
listen. Why, the wind's talking all the time.
Can't you hear it?"</p>

<p>George stood still and listened. "It does
seem to be saying something. It sounds just
like: '<em>Oh-oo! Oh-oo!</em>'"</p>

<p>Alexander laughed&mdash;such a funny, wuffy
laugh. "It's humming a tune to the trees.
Can't you see them nodding their heads in time
to the music? If the wind were angry they
would be shivering and shaking with fright.
Perhaps it will talk to us by and by."</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried the cock, looking round,
"I have to get back to work or else the wind
will be coming along and scolding me for
wasting time."</p>

<p>They walked along down a winding path, up
a little hill, down another, and there in front
stood a post with a large finger pointing
straight ahead.</p>

<p>"Here you are!" said the cock. "Go straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
on until you arrive there. The weather will be
quite fine, and your fortune is waiting for you.
If you want to get back ask any of my family
you may meet and they will show you the way.
Good-bye!" He flapped his wings, crowed
"<em>Cock-a-doodle-doo!</em>" and disappeared.</p>

<p>George went up to the finger-post, and there,
printed on it in large letters, was: "T<span class="smcapa">HIS WAY TO</span>
O<span class="smcapa">NCE-UPON-A</span>-T<span class="smcapa">IME</span>."</p>

<p>"Another adventure!" he cried. "Come on,
Alexander!"&mdash;but Alexander was already
scampering down the road, barking joyfully.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="p6"><em>A Nice Dragon</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was really very jolly in this Once-upon-a-Time
Land, though nothing wonderful
happened at first. There were beautiful
green trees, scattered about everywhere in twos
and threes as if they were keeping one another
company; there were large fields full of flowers;
little rivers bustling along as if they were in
a great hurry to get somewhere, and then
turning a corner and flowing quite slowly as
if they had remembered that it didn't really
matter after all; and far off in the distance,
with snowy peaks glittering in the sunshine&mdash;mountains!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The road led them along up and down like
a switchback. It was quite easy walking; in
fact, the road almost seemed to walk by itself.
Whenever they felt thirsty there was a
spring of delicious cold water bubbling up by
the roadside, and when they felt hungry there
were apples, pears, blackberries, strawberries,
and raspberries all growing and ready for anybody
who would take the trouble to pick
them.</p>

<p>"I think it's time we got somewhere," said
George.</p>

<p>"We're nearly there," replied Alexander. "I
know She lives not far from here."</p>

<p>"She? Who is She?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Why, Her, of course," and Alexander ran
on ahead and round the corner before George
could ask another question. Suddenly he
heard a loud barking, and thinking that Alexander
was chasing a rabbit, or perhaps a cat,
he ran as hard as he could, turned the corner,
and saw&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Well, I never! It was wonderful, and yet it
was in Once-upon-a-Time Land, where things
like this happen every day. It was just as
one sees it in picture-books, only naturally it
looked <em>ever</em> so much bigger than one expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"A dragon!" cried George. "I haven't got
a sword or anything at all to fight with. If
it begins to breathe fire it will burn me right
up! And what <em>is</em> Alexander doing? Why, I
do believe he's playing with it."</p>

<p>And so he was, and what was even funnier
still, the dragon actually seemed to like it.
Alexander ran down its long, long back,
which rippled and shone in the sunshine like
scales of golden flame, bit the end of its tail
playfully, and barked right under its great
nose. The dragon opened its great mouth,
showing rows and rows of sharp, pointed
teeth, and laughed a really jolly laugh.</p>

<p>"You seem to want a game," it said, in a
great deep voice which sounded as if it came
from somewhere half-way down its back.
"Come on, little George; just wait until I
uncurl myself."</p>

<p>It gave itself a shake and uncoiled all the
twists in its back, which cracked like little
pistols, <em>bang! bang!</em> then jumped once or
twice in the air to stretch its legs.</p>

<p>"See if you can catch my tail!" it cried,
and then began a regular game of 'Catch me
who can!' The dragon didn't seem to run exactly,
but moved along somewhat like a snake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
only ever so fast, with its tail hanging temptingly
behind. Every time George put out his
hand to catch hold of it, <em>whisk!</em>&mdash;away it
went again! Alexander leapt this way and
that way, and every time he came to the
ground again found that the dragon was not
where he expected it to be. Then the dragon
began to make loops and curves of itself, as
if it were writing all the letters of the alphabet
with its long back.</p>

<p>At last all three lay down on the ground
quite out of breath.</p>

<p>"I'm not so old as I thought I was," said
the dragon. "I haven't had such a good
game for a long time. <em>Phew!</em> I'm absolutely
boiling hot!" and out came a long tongue
like yards and yards of red flannel, and it
smoothed its scales as far as it could reach.</p>

<p>"Alexander does just the same when he's
washing himself," thought George.</p>

<p>"So you're going to look for your fortune?"
said the dragon after a while.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied George, "I am. I hope Alexander
will find his too."</p>

<p>"I hope so," smiled the dragon. "I like to
see people who are looking for fortunes, though
they don't always find them, even when they're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
under their very noses. I knew a dragon once&mdash;it's
not a long story&mdash;who went to look for his
fortune."</p>

<p>"Was it in Once-upon-a-Time Land?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied the dragon. "People
don't understand dragons anywhere else. They
tell the most stupid stories about us, as if we
went about doing nothing but eat up people and
breathe fire. You might as well say that dogs
do nothing else but kill cats," he added, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Alexander looked very solemn, and as if
butter would not melt in his mouth.</p>

<p>"Well, this dragon, as I was saying, went out
to look for his fortune. He was quite a young
dragon, and ought to have stayed at home as his
mother told him. He had never been farther
than the end of the valley where they lived,
though of course he thought he knew all about
everything.</p>

<p>"So his mother kissed him good-bye, told
him to take care not to catch cold, and
watched him disappear in the distance. It
was a fine day, and the young dragon went
along thinking of all the great things he was
going to do, and bumping his head against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
trees because he never looked where he was
going.</p>

<p>"He met nobody and nothing for a long time.
About midday he began to feel very hungry,
and almost wished he were at home again. But
at last, on the top of a hill, he saw a man
standing by the door of a house; at least, he
thought it must be a house, but he wasn't quite
sure, for he had never seen one before. It was
really a miller standing by his mill, whistling
for the wind to come and turn the sails
round.</p>

<p>"He was a friendly miller. He invited the
dragon to rest for a while and have something
to eat. After the dragon had eaten forty loaves
and two hundred currant buns and drunk all
the water out of the water-butt, he began to
feel better, and told the miller what he was
looking for.</p>

<p>"'Looking for your fortune, are you?' said
the miller. 'Well, you've come to the right
place, for the road to fortune starts from here
and from nowhere else.'</p>

<p>"He saw that the dragon was quite young
and rather vain, so he thought he would play a
joke upon him.</p>

<p>"'Do you see those long fingers?' he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
pointing to the sails of the mill. 'They are
pointing out the way to your fortune.'</p>

<p>"'Oh!' replied the dragon. 'They are all
pointing different ways. How can I tell in
which direction to go? Does my fortune lie
everywhere all around me?'</p>

<p>"'No, no,' said the miller. 'Just stand quietly
here for a bit, and by and by you will learn all
about it.' Then he went inside the mill and
waited to see what would happen.</p>

<p>"Presently the breeze heard the miller
whistling and came blowing along in answer to
his call. The sails of the mill shook, and then,
<em>very</em> slowly, commenced to turn.</p>

<p>"'Dear me!' thought the young dragon.
'They seem to be pointing in a different
direction now. This is very funny. I must see
what it means,' and he walked right up to the
sails, which were now whirling round quite fast.</p>

<p>"Suddenly, <em>smack!</em> on his nose came the first
sail; <em>smack!</em> came the second, and <span class="smcapa">SMACK!</span> the
third.</p>

<p>"The dragon tumbled head over heels backward.
He was so frightened that he picked
himself up and ran away as fast as he could
with his tail between his legs, never once looking
behind him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"The miller laughed until he was so tired
that he could laugh no more. 'That will teach
him not to be so greedy next time,' he said, for he
was rather vexed at seeing so many of his loaves
and buns disappear down the dragon's throat.</p>

<p>"The dragon went on running until, to his
great surprise, he found himself at the door of
his home. His mother saw him coming, and
there was a good tea waiting for him, you may
be sure.</p>

<p>"He was very glad to find himself safe and
sound and far away from the dreadful mill, but
at the same time felt very sorry that he had not
found his fortune. His mother listened to
everything he told her, and then she said: 'My
son, you have found your fortune, after all.'</p>

<p>"'Where?' asked her son, looking around him
in surprise, as if he expected to see he didn't
know what.</p>

<p>"'There, my child; it lies there, right under
your very nose.'</p>

<p>"He looked down, and there he saw&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, what was it?" cried George.</p>

<p>"Can't you guess?" said the dragon. "Dear
me, I <em>am</em> surprised. Why, the dragon guessed
at once. They don't seem to teach boys anything
at school nowadays."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I learn heaps of things," said George.</p>

<p>"<em>Umph!</em>" snorted the dragon. "I expect it's
just heaps of rubbish. I don't suppose you
know half as much as a dragon of the same age
as yourself."</p>

<p>"But dragons don't go to school, do they?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"Why not?" replied the dragon. "Of course
they do; but they don't sit on benches in a
schoolroom. They learn out of doors, which is
the proper place for a school. They learn useful
things, such as how to see what they see and
hear what they hear; not to go about the world
like blind mice, not believing in the fairies like
a little boy I once heard of."</p>

<p>Alexander laughed. "He means you, George.
You know, you never liked fairy stories, did
you?"</p>

<p>George blushed. "I never said I didn't believe
in them, but it always seemed as if they
couldn't be real."</p>

<p>"Are <em>you</em> real?" suddenly asked the dragon.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," said George. "I'm as real
as real can be."</p>

<p>"Well, you're not a bit, not a little bit real,"
replied the dragon. "Any boy who is lucky
enough to find his way into this country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
<em>then</em> doesn't believe in the fairies, is not more
real than a soap bubble, and will burst into
little bits just as a bubble does."</p>

<p>Alexander laughed. "I should love to see
George all in little bits. I wonder if we could
ever fit him together again."</p>

<p>"No; he'd be just like Humpty Dumpty," said
the dragon. "There have been hundreds of
little boys like that, and I have never heard
of one who was mended again. Some were
patched up, but there were always pieces
missing, and they were never the same boys.
Their mothers soon got tired of them and gave
them away to the rag-and-bone man."</p>

<p>George sat quite silent for some time. He
didn't like being laughed at, and felt that both
the dragon and Alexander thought him quite
as stupid&mdash;or even more so&mdash;as the dragon in
the story.</p>

<p>"Come, we'd better be starting," said the
dragon. "She doesn't like to be kept waiting."</p>

<p>George was just about to ask who She might
be, but he shut his mouth with a snap and
pretended that he knew all about it.</p>

<p>"Get on my back!" ordered the dragon, and
George jumped on at once and seated himself
comfortably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Off the dragon went like a great, long railway
train, faster and faster, until they shot into a
forest and it became as dark as the darkest
tunnel.</p>

<p>"<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>" barked Alexander. "Hold
tight, George!"</p>

<p class="p5"><em>The Witch</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">S</span>UDDENLY the dragon's eyes lit up as
if they were lamps. They could see a
little way ahead, but all around it was
so dark that you could almost feel it. George
thought&mdash;he was always having funny thoughts
now&mdash;that if he put his hand out some of the
black darkness would rub off on it.</p>

<p>After a time they seemed to be going down-hill.
Far away gleamed a light which grew
brighter and brighter every moment. At last
George could see that they were close to the
mouth of a large cave, in front of which sat
a perfectly enormous black cat with green
eyes shining like lights on a railway signal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Its tail was standing straight up on end,
black and bushy; never had George seen
such a tail before. The dragon went on past
the cat into the cave, round corners, on and
on until at last he stopped with a jerk, and
George fell off his back.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said the dragon, "just in
time. I thought at first we were late, and
then, my word!&mdash;we should have caught it!
Come on!" and he led the way into the
witch's kitchen.</p>

<p>All that George could see at first was a
huge open fireplace upon which great logs of
wood were crackling. Over the fire hung a big
round kettle from which at times came weird
gurgling sounds. The queerest shadows of
goblins and imps danced about as if they
were really alive. Altogether it was a most
uncomfortable place to be in.</p>

<p>Curled up on the hearth was another cat;
a yellow animal with red eyes which stared
and stared at them as if it wondered who on
earth they could be.</p>

<p>"So here you are at last!" said a voice
from somewhere, so suddenly that it made
George jump.</p>

<p>He looked round on every side, but for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
time could see nothing. At last, in the dim
light, he could just make out what looked
like the figure of an old, old woman with a
very crooked back and a queer, wrinkled face.
She was sitting in a dark corner in a high-backed
chair, looking into the fire as if she
were reading all kinds of stories in it.</p>

<p>"Come here, George," she said. "Tell me
all about your fortune."</p>

<p>It was really rather annoying that everybody
seemed to know all about George and
what he was going to do. However, it
couldn't be helped, so he walked up to the
witch, feeling just a little bit afraid, and
looked straight into her eyes.</p>

<p>Her face was covered with hundreds of
little wrinkles, which crossed and recrossed
one another almost without end. She looked
as if she had lived for hundreds and hundreds
of years, and was, oh, so tired of everything!
Her eyes were very bright, and shone with a
pale light which made George feel a little bit
giddy at first, though he couldn't think why.</p>

<p>Her voice was quite gentle, rather sad, and
sounded as if it came from far, far, away.
Perhaps it had grown tired too.</p>

<p>"So you are following your fortune?" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
the witch. "Dear me! Do you know who I
am?"</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am," replied George, "you're
a witch."</p>

<p>"And a very wicked old woman too, who
turns little boys into frogs and toads, and
flies through the air on a broomstick. Isn't
that what you've learned about me?" asked
the witch, with a queer smile. Where had
George seen that smile before?</p>

<p>He blushed rosy red, for he certainly had
always heard that witches were wicked women.
Had not Father once called some old woman
who was always telling disagreeable stories
about other people behind their backs a
wicked witch? George had asked this same
old woman if she had brought her broomstick
with her. She had been quite cross, and
called him "a rude little boy."</p>

<p>"If you please, ma'am," he said, "I expect
there are good witches as well as bad witches."</p>

<p>"Ah, well! Let us hope I'm a good witch,
one who will help you to find your fortune, and
Alexander's too"; and the witch stretched out
her thin old hands to the fire to warm them.</p>

<p>Wonders will never cease! George suddenly
caught sight of Alexander lying down side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
by side with the yellow cat&mdash;and when he
was at home not a single cat was allowed to
put even one foot inside the garden!</p>

<p>"He's quite an old friend," said the witch.
"My dear Golden Girl and he are almost like
brother and sister."</p>

<p>Alexander licked the end of the cat's nose,
and she patted him gently with her paw and
purred.</p>

<p>"Sit down and tell me all about it," continued
the witch, pushing a three-legged stool
toward George. He perched himself on it
with his legs swinging in the air, and commenced
to talk&mdash;at least, he always said afterward
that he did&mdash;but what with the witch
nodding, the cat purring, and the kettle boiling
it is more than likely that he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Suddenly the kettle began to boil furiously,
and clouds of steam poured out of its spout.</p>

<p>"Nearly ready! Nearly ready!" said the
witch, and counted slowly up to ten. Then:
"Take off the lid, Alexander!" she cried.</p>

<p>Alexander jumped up and lifted off the kettle-lid
with his tail as if he had been used to doing
it all his life.</p>

<p>In a moment the kitchen was full of steam,
which wreathed and curled itself into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
queerest shapes and figures. George wondered
what was going to happen next, but sat still
and said nothing.</p>

<p>The witch rose from her chair and hobbled
up to the kettle, helping herself along with a
long-handled stick. She leaned over the kettle,
looking down into it for a moment or two, then,
waving her stick, commenced to sing in a high,
shrill voice. It sounded at first as if she were
singing the multiplication table. George remembered
bits of it, and this is what he said
she sang:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, ha! Ah, ha!" sang Golden Girl and
Alexander together, and the kettle bubbled
and boiled: "Oh, ho! Oh, ho!"</p>

<p>This went on for quite a long time, and
George wondered if the witch were going to cut
off a lock of his hair. How nasty a stew with
hair in it would taste. <em>Ugh!</em></p>

<p>"It's time to start now. Are we all ready?
Dragon! Where's that lazy dragon?" cried the
witch.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" replied the dragon, appearing
from somewhere or other: "I'm quite ready.
Will you ride on your catoplane?"</p>

<p>George wondered whatever a catoplane might
be, but was too polite to ask. The witch quickly
put on a long cloak and waved her stick, and
the wall of the kitchen flew open.</p>

<p>"Come along; don't keep me waiting!" she
said to George, and he jumped off his stool and
followed her. He could see nothing, but felt
that they were in the open air again.</p>

<p>"Here's my broomstick!" he heard the witch
say, with a laugh; he felt himself lifted on to
something, and then&mdash;<em>whirrrr! whizzz!</em>&mdash;off
they went.</p>

<p>"Oh, are we in an aeroplane, please?" asked
George, feeling tremendously excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aeroplane, indeed!" sniffed the witch. "I
should like to see the aeroplane that could fly
as fast as this. Look and see for yourself,
George!"</p>

<p>George looked in front of him. He certainly
seemed to be seated on something like a broomstick,
and right in front of him sat the yellow
cat, flashing its red eyes into the darkness like
searchlights. Alexander was seated quite close
to her, looking as pleased as Punch.</p>

<p>George looked behind him and heard the noise
of an engine, <em>throb, throb</em>, and saw a black something
turning, turning without stopping.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's the motor," he said.</p>

<p>"Guess again, George!" laughed the witch.</p>

<p>George looked and looked. "No, I can't
guess," he confessed.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;wait and see!" And the witch
smiled. Her smile was just like&mdash;no, it wasn't....
Oh, it was very puzzling!</p>

<p class="p6"><em>The High Mountains</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">"W</span>E must be going faster than a railway
train," said George.</p>

<p>"We're going faster than twenty
trains," replied the witch. "In a minute or
two we shall catch up the daylight.... Ah,
there you can see it already!" And she
pointed to a speck of light toward which they
were travelling at lightning speed.</p>

<p>The light grew brighter and brighter, and
at last they shot into the most dazzling sunshine,
and there, ahead of them, were the
lovely mountains with their snowy tops all
aglow. They were travelling high up above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the land, and the only thing to be seen was
a tremendously tall tower which stood erect
in the middle of the plain.</p>

<p>"Blow the horn!" cried the witch, and
Alexander barked "<em>Wu-uff!</em>" three times,
while Golden Girl <em>miaowed</em> like ten railway
engines all blowing off steam at the same
time. The tower suddenly came to life, and,
to George's astonishment, as they drew closer
he saw that it was a giant holding out a hand
nearly as big as a station platform.</p>

<p>They flew straight on and alighted gently
on the outstretched hand, and then the engines
stopped. George looked behind him and saw
two large cats, as black as coal, sitting at the
end of the broom.</p>

<p>"There, you see!" said the witch. "You
never would have guessed."</p>

<p>"I haven't guessed now," replied George.
"Did those two cats drive the machine along?"</p>

<p>"Of course!" laughed the witch. "That's
why it's called a catoplane. If you wait until we
start again you'll see how it's done." Then,
turning, she called out: "Good-morning,
friend! Are you quite well to-day?"</p>

<p>"Good-morning!" replied the giant in a deep
voice which rumbled and rolled like thunder.
"I'm fairly well, thank you. What brings you
here?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="illowe43" src="images/i_122fp.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>THE LIGHT GREW BRIGHTER AND BRIGHTER</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're just giving George and Alexander a
lift. George is following his fortune, you know."</p>

<p>"Ah, to be sure!" said the giant. "I remember
hearing about it the last time the storks
passed this way. They generally bring me some
news of what is going on down below there."</p>

<p>George looked up at him with wide-open
eyes. It isn't every day that one gets a
chance of seeing a live giant, except in a
circus&mdash;and even then they are disappointing,
for they are not really a little bit like the
picture which is shown outside. No circus
would be big enough to hold this giant. He
looked as if he were quite a mile long. His
face was as big as an enormous moon, but
he looked quite kind and smiled all the time.</p>

<p>"Are you off to the mountains?" he asked. "I
expect you'll find Him there. He's not been very
busy lately, but He's expecting you, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"Who's 'Him,' please?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Wait and see," replied the witch. "Little
boys should always wait, and then&mdash;perhaps&mdash;they
will see."</p>

<p>There seemed to be a great deal of waiting
in this country, but George was learning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
be patient. Alexander was busy talking to
the cat, and the witch was whispering in the
giant's ear, as he had bent down his head quite
close to her.</p>

<p>"I wonder why he stands there all by himself,"
thought George. "He must feel very lonely
with his feet down ever so far below him and his
head in the clouds. I wonder if he ever goes to
bed, and how does he get enough to eat? I
shouldn't like to be as big as that."</p>

<p>"He wants to know all about you, you see,"
said the witch to the giant. George gave such
a start! He had forgotten that she was there.
How had she been able to read his thoughts?</p>

<p>"I'm a witch, my dear, and can tell everything,"
smiled the witch, answering his thoughts.
"I can see right inside your little head if I want
to. If I couldn't, I shouldn't be a witch at all."</p>

<p>"Well, it's rather a long story to tell you
all about myself," began the giant. "It would
take weeks and weeks. Even then we shouldn't
have finished, for then there would be the story
of all the weeks during which you had been
listening to me."</p>

<p>"But I should know all about <em>that</em>," said
George. "You would have been telling me the
story, of course, and I should have been here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>The giant thought for a moment. "Yes ...
but <em>then</em> I should have to tell you the story of
how I told you the story ... and even then it
wouldn't have an end, for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're half asleep!" cried the witch. "We
can't wait to hear any more just now. You
can tell it to George by and by."</p>

<p>"It's always by and by," grumbled the giant.
"I've been trying to tell some one for years
and years, and just as I'm going to begin it's
always time to go somewhere and do something.
Where's the dragon?"</p>

<p>"Playing with his tail, or else fast asleep, I
expect," said the witch. "I never in all my life
knew such a lazy creature. He's only awake
when there's a chance of a game. If he comes
along after we've gone, tell <em>him</em> your story."</p>

<p>"It's no use. He just jumps about and never
listens. The last time he was here he played
with my boots and bit a great piece out of one
of them. He said he was sorry, but I've had a
sore toe ever since. You wouldn't believe what
a lot I have to put up with," and the poor giant
looked as if he were going to cry.</p>

<p>"There, there!" said the witch soothingly.
"You shall come with us if you're good, only
don't cry. Remember, the last time you flooded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the whole country and gave all of us dreadful
colds. And what a bother it was making extra
handkerchiefs for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, may I come with you?" cried the giant.
"I <em>should</em> like that! I get such pins and
needles in my feet standing here."</p>

<p>"Why do you stand here?" asked George.</p>

<p>"To look out, of course," said the witch; and
then, as she saw George was going to ask
another question, she gave the order to start.</p>

<p>The two black cats curled their tails round
the end of the broom and then began to turn
round and round in the air.</p>

<p>"Doesn't it make them dreadfully giddy?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"No, of course not," said the witch. "It
might do so if they were ordinary cats&mdash;but
they're not. Listen to them purring."</p>

<p>What George had imagined was the throbbing
of an engine was indeed the purring of the two
cats as they whirled round in opposite directions.
The witch was riding straight toward the
mountains, and the giant with huge strides was
keeping close by their side. He nodded to them
from time to time, and George waved his hand
in reply.</p>

<p>He was really a nice giant, and it was just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
well to keep him cheerful and happy, for it
would be very disagreeable to have a flood.</p>

<p>The mountains came nearer and nearer, and
George thought he had never seen anything so
splendid in all his life. Even the giant looked
quite small beside them.</p>

<p>"Are we going right to the top, the very tip-top
of that mountain?" asked George, pointing.</p>

<p>The witch did not answer for a moment.
Then she turned to him and said: "Sing!"</p>

<p>"What shall I sing?" asked George in
surprise, for he only knew some old nursery
rhymes, and wasn't quite certain if he could
remember the words or not.</p>

<p>"Listen to the music," answered the witch.
"That will tell you the words."</p>

<p>True enough, there was music in the air all
around them, as if the trees, the water, and the
wind were all playing together. George listened,
and then, to his surprise, began to sing all about
the thoughts which he had been turning over in
his mind.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Tom Tiddler's Ground</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HEY were now quite close to the
mountains, and the witch gave the
order to come to earth. The catoplane
floated gently down until it came to rest in
a beautiful grassy spot all ringed round with
trees.</p>

<p>The giant was standing just a little way off,
looking around him.</p>

<p>"Can you see Him?" called the witch.</p>

<p>"Yes, He's just coming," cried the giant.
"<em>Coo-ee! Coo-ee!</em>"&mdash;and he waved his great
hand to some one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>The witch, George, Alexander, and the cats
all sat down and waited. Presently a funny
little man came running along through the
trees. He had a queer wrinkled-up face, with
a smile in one corner of his mouth. He wore
a high sugar-loaf hat with a bunch of feathers
stuck in it, and a long golden cloak which
floated behind him in the wind.</p>

<p>He stepped right into the middle of their
circle, and, taking off his hat, made a low
bow.</p>

<p>"Welcome!" he said, "welcome! I hope
you are all quite well. So you want to follow
your fortune?"&mdash;with a queer look out of the
corner of his eye at George.</p>

<p>"Yes, please," replied George. "At least, I
suppose I'm following it. I don't know where
it is or where I am."</p>

<p>"To be sure!" chuckled the little man, sitting
down suddenly as if he worked with springs.
"Well, of course, you're <em>here</em>!"</p>

<p>"I know that," laughed George.</p>

<p>"If you know that, why did you ask me?"
said the little man, cocking his hat on one
side. "You're here: you might be there, but
you're not. Now you know <em>all</em> about it....
Would you like something to eat?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes, please!" cried George, "I should
like some&mdash;&mdash;" And he stopped for a moment
to think what he would like.</p>

<p>"Ask for what you want," said the little
man. "I expect it's here. There are all sorts
of things lying about if one knows where to look
for them."</p>

<p>George looked around him. "I don't see
anything&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Of course not!" snapped the witch. "How
can you when you don't know what to look for."</p>

<p>George did not wait a moment. "A plate
of roast beef and potatoes, and a large bone
for Alexander, please!"</p>

<p>"Help yourself!" said the little man.</p>

<p>There, sure enough, was a large plate of
beef on George's knees, and Alexander was
contentedly gnawing a huge bone.</p>

<p>"I've got no knife and fork," said George,
looking at his plate longingly.</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask for them?" grumbled
the witch. "You don't expect knives and forks
to come of themselves, do you?"</p>

<p>"A knife and fork, please!" He had hardly
spoken when Golden Girl got up&mdash;where had
she found them?&mdash;and handed him a knife
and fork; just the right size too!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aren't you going to have something to
eat?" asked George.</p>

<p>"By and by," replied the witch. "Perhaps
I shall eat <em>you</em> if I get very hungry," and she
smiled as if it were a good joke.</p>

<p>There never was such good roast beef, and
George was quite sorry when it was all
finished.</p>

<p>"Might I have some apple tart&mdash;and a spoon,"
he added quickly, just remembering in time.</p>

<p>The apple tart appeared from nowhere, and
George, when he had finished it, said his grace
to himself, so as not to make the others feel
that they had had no lunch.</p>

<p>The little man had wrapped himself up in
his cloak and was sitting quite still. Now he
jumped up. "What is your fortune?" he
asked George.</p>

<p>"I don't know. No one ever told me&mdash;unless,
of course, it's money. Father always
says he's going to make his fortune some day,
and he means money. I should like <em>lots</em> of
money."</p>

<p>"Lots of money, eh?"&mdash;and the queer little
man smiled a queer little smile. "Well, you've
come to the right place for <em>that</em>!" and they all
burst out laughing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the little man sang in a voice like a
shrill tin whistle:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Here we are on Tom Tiddler's ground,</div>
  <div class="i1">Picking up gold and silver,"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>until the echoes answered: "Gold and silver!
Gold and silver!"</p>

<p>George stared at him. "Are <em>you</em> Tom
Tiddler?"</p>

<p>The little man bowed low. "At your service!
This is my land. Make yourself at home, I
beg you," and then sat down again.</p>

<p>"But I don't see any gold and silver," said
George.</p>

<p>"Pick it up!" replied Tom Tiddler. "You'll
see it quick enough then."</p>

<p>George bent down, and there, sure enough,
in his hand was a lump of something sparkling
in the light.</p>

<p>"Gold!" he cried, and he commenced to
pick up more and more. He soon had a large
heap by his side.</p>

<p>"How can I carry all this away?" he thought
to himself.</p>

<p>Tom Tiddler jumped up and handed him a
large sack.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" and George shovelled all
the gold and silver into it, while all the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
sat watching him in silence. No one offered to
help him, which he thought rather rude.</p>

<p>The sack was very heavy when he had filled
it, and he could only just manage to lift it.</p>

<p>"Now that you've found your fortune, what
are you going to do?" asked Tom Tiddler.
"Go home, I suppose, and spend it." And
they all laughed once more.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything to laugh at," said
George. "I would go home, only I don't
know my way."</p>

<p>"It's straight ahead until you get there,
and then you stop," replied Tom Tiddler.</p>

<p>George thought this rather rude and not
funny, so he turned and walked away a short
distance. He felt as if he would like to cry,
and began to wish he were at home again.
Something cold touched his hand, and there
was Alexander looking up at him, just in the
old way, as if he were saying: "I'm here;
don't mind what the others say. I'm always
your friend."</p>

<p>George stooped down and patted him. "Dear
old Alexander! Let us go back now. I don't
like Tom Tiddler at all."</p>

<p>Alexander wagged his tail, but said never a
word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sudden <em>whirr</em>&mdash;and there was the
witch flying away far above their heads. George
was rather glad, for he felt that he wanted only
Alexander and nobody else.</p>

<p>Tom Tiddler came up to him again, and said
with a bow: "May I show you the way, little
master? You mustn't mind their laughter;
you will understand better by and by. So many
come here, following their fortunes like you, and
don't even know what their fortunes are."</p>

<p>With another bow he turned and led the way
up a rocky path which seemed to lead right into
the heart of the mountains.</p>

<p>George followed him, carrying his bag. How
heavy it was and how it hurt his shoulder! He
got hot and then hotter, and at last, speaking
half to himself, he said: "It is too heavy for me
to carry.... I can't carry it any farther....
I'd sooner have no fortune at all if it's as difficult
to take away as this is.... Oh, I wish it were
gone!" Then, all in a moment, the sack no
longer seemed to weigh anything. It might
have been empty.</p>

<p>He felt so pleased and happy that he raced
along after Tom Tiddler, but he could never
quite catch him up, for the little man skipped
along, jumping from rock to rock like a young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
goat. At last he gave a bigger jump than ever,
and&mdash;<em>hey presto!</em>&mdash;like a Jack-in-the-box he
was gone.</p>

<p>George rubbed his eyes. Yes, there was no
doubt about it. Unless he had slipped through
a hole in the ground or flown away, no one could
tell what had become of him. He turned to
Alexander, and was just going to ask him what
they should do when he saw the great round
face of the giant appear, as if it were floating in
the air.</p>

<p>"This is a funny place," thought George.
"One never knows what is going to happen
next. Where did the poor old giant come from,
I wonder."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said the giant as he caught sight of
them. "Hullo! Here you are at last. I've
been waiting for you. They've all gone, I
suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, they've gone. How did you get here?"
asked George.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm just standing down in the valley
below. I can put my head over the edge of
the hill, and it's more comfortable for talking.
Look over!"</p>

<p>George peeped over the edge of the cliff, and
there, sure enough, below them in the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
were the great feet belonging to the giant.
They looked, so far off were they, as if they
must belong to some one else.</p>

<p>It was quite a long time before the giant
spoke again. "Let us talk. You do want to
talk, don't you? I was just thinking over one
or two stories to tell you&mdash;not the whole of my
life, you know&mdash;that's very long, as I told you
before. It's a queer thing about stories. They
grow just as you and I do. Every time I tell a
story I find that it has grown longer. Some of
them, so I've been told, have no end."</p>

<p>"Oh," said George, "but they must have an
end, however long they are! They generally
end with 'and so they married and lived happily
ever after.'"</p>

<p>"I never heard <em>that</em> kind of story. It couldn't
end that way if you were telling a story about
a sausage. Sausages don't marry, do they?"
And the giant laughed until all the echoes
joined in with "<em>Ha, ha! Ho, ho!</em>"</p>

<p>"Is the story you are going to tell me about
a sausage?" asked George.</p>

<p>The giant did not reply, but after a short
pause he began: "Once there was a sausage.
It was the most beautiful sausage I ever saw.
Everybody loved it. It belonged to a prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
who was very, very rich. He had so many
sausages that he was never able to count them,
and he had to go long past twelve times in the
multiplication table even then.</p>

<p>"This sausage was large, round, and covered
all over with gold paper to keep it from catching
cold. It was rather delicate when it was young,
but as it grew up&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sausages don't grow up!" exclaimed George
in surprise.</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt me," answered the giant.
"As it grew up it became stronger and more
beautiful every day. The prince was never tired
of looking at it and admiring it.</p>

<p>"One day he thought it was time for him to
get married, and so he wrote a letter to a lovely
princess who lived not far away, and asked her
if she would accept his hand and his sausages.</p>

<p>"The princess, however, was not very fond of
sausages. She had once been ill after eating
them, and had never cared for them since. So
she wrote back and said that she was very sorry
but she could not accept his kind invitation.</p>

<p>"The prince became very sorrowful when he
received her letter, for she was a beautiful
princess&mdash;almost as beautiful as his sausage. So
he made up his mind to go and see where he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
could find a wife who would like both him and
his sausages.</p>

<p>"He mounted his horse and rode away," continued
the giant in a slow, sleepy voice, and
George closed his eyes for just one minute, he
felt so drowsy....</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Over the Hills and Far Away</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">G</span>EORGE woke with a start.</p>

<p>"And so the princess said to the
prince: 'I had no idea it was a <em>golden</em>
sausage. Why didn't you tell me that at first?
It makes all the difference.' And so ... and
so...." the giant had fallen fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Of course, they married and lived happily
ever after!" cried George. "Didn't I tell
you so?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. Suddenly he heard
what sounded to him like thunder. It rumbled
and rolled, nearer and nearer, louder and
louder. At last a tremendous clap made the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
stones roll down the mountain-side, and the
trees quivered and shook in fright.</p>

<p>"What shall we do, Alexander?" exclaimed
George, for he hated thunder; and he wasn't
in bed, so he couldn't bury his head under the
clothes. If you do this&mdash;as everybody knows&mdash;the
thunder can't get at you, and just rolls
and bumps about under the bed until it gets
tired.</p>

<p>Alexander yawned and stretched himself.
"Oh, it's only the old giant snoring. I don't
wonder, after talking so long about princesses
and sausages. Nobody ate a sausage in the
whole story. I wish I'd been there, that's all!
We'd better be going. He won't wake up for
at least a week now."</p>

<p>Sure enough, the poor old giant was fast
asleep, and snoring so that you could have
heard him twenty miles off. You could hardly
hear yourself speak for the noise.</p>

<p>Well, it was no use waiting, so George and
Alexander started to follow the little path
which wound in and out, like the letter S, up
the mountain-side. It was the easiest thing
in the world to climb. It was as nice as going
upstairs on a very soft carpet, up&mdash;up, until
they were right above the fir-trees, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
grew colder and colder. In another moment
they were walking on real snow!</p>

<p>"We're nearly at the top now," said Alexander.</p>

<p>George had never been up to the top of a
mountain before. Fancy going home and
telling everybody what he'd done! Of course
he would have to pretend that it was really
very difficult, just as people do in books. But
would anyone believe him?</p>

<p>Up&mdash;up, until at last there they were right
on the very tip-top. Far below for miles and
miles stretched a great plain, green and beautiful
to behold. Was it fancy, that faint sound of
music?</p>

<p>"Alexander, where does that music come
from?" asked George.</p>

<p>"It comes from there," replied Alexander.
"Over there, you know."</p>

<p>"But I don't know&mdash;and where is 'over
there,' and why does nobody ever answer
questions properly?"</p>

<p>Alexander looked as if he were going to say,
"Wait and see," but George looked really
vexed&mdash;so he didn't.</p>

<p>"We'd better go down and see," he said, and
bounded down the mountain-side. Oh, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
have no idea how fast they ran! It was almost
like flying.</p>

<p>At last they came to a forest of pine-trees
through which the path seemed to lead. Into
the forest they ran helter-skelter. There must
have been thousands of trees; there seemed
to be no end to them, and no way through
except by the little path which curled in and
out and round about.</p>

<p>Curly paths are the best; they enjoy having
a little fun, for just as you think you are getting
to wherever you want to go you find that the
path has turned itself round and is staring you
in the face.</p>

<p>Straight paths just go there. They are
rather dull unless you are in a hurry, and
then it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>This path was sometimes curly and sometimes
not. It never seemed to be quite sure
what it wanted to do. At last it made up its
mind, unrolled itself, and ran as straight as
the straightest line right through the wood
and out into the sun again.</p>

<p>"Look there!" cried George, pointing, to
the branch of a tree just in front of them.
There, perched on it and shining away like
anything, was the little weathercock!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"You've come at last," he crowed. "It's
just time for tea. Come along!" and he
fluttered down to the ground beside them.</p>

<p>"How did you get here?" asked George.</p>

<p>"I've been here all the time," answered the
weathercock. "Where else should I be?"</p>

<p>George gazed all round him; then he caught
sight of a little house he thought he knew,
with the smoke curling up from its chimneys.
"Why, that's <em>my</em> house! How did it get here?"</p>

<p>"Really, you do ask a lot of questions,"
complained the little cock. "The house hasn't
moved. You've been moving. Didn't you want
to get back here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, but&mdash;oh, well, I don't understand.
I thought we were going somewhere
else all the time."</p>

<p>"There is no such place as 'somewhere else'
that I ever heard of," said the cock. "Where
did you expect to get to? You said you wanted
to get home, and here you are, aren't you?"</p>

<p>Alexander ran on ahead and disappeared
through the garden gate. George waited for a
moment to watch the cock fly up to his little
perch on the roof again, and then went in. Tea
was spread on the table just as usual. Oh, it
was good to be home again! There was no time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
for talking. George put down his sack, which
he had held in his hand all this time and quite
forgotten. What's the good of talking at tea-time,
except to say "Yes, please," and "Thank
you"? Besides, it is rude to talk with your
mouth full, and if you are enjoying your tea
your mouth is full all the time. Anyway, that
is what George thought. He didn't even stop to
see if Alexander was getting anything to eat.</p>

<p>At last he finished, and Alexander, who had
found some biscuits somewhere, licked the last
crumb from his nose.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your sack, George," he said, in
a queer kind of voice.</p>

<p>George gave a start of surprise, then picked
up the sack from the floor. It had grown
quite, quite small, and weighed almost nothing
at all. He opened it, and there inside was&mdash;what
do you think?&mdash;a heap of golden-coloured
leaves!</p>

<p>He burst out laughing! So this was his
wonderful fortune!</p>

<p>Alexander gazed at him, and neither of them
said a word for a moment.</p>

<p>"I see," said George. "I think I see. My
fortune isn't made of gold at all. Well, I don't
mind a little bit. The sack was very heavy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
carry at first, and I felt as cross as cross could
be. I'll put these leaves on the fire."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried Alexander. "Don't do
that! You must <em>never</em> throw away anything
that Tom Tiddler has given you. It might
bring you bad luck.... You know, so many
people throw away their good fortune, and they
never, never get a chance of finding it a second
time. And they never find their way back here."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that other people have been
here in the house?" asked George.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. This is <em>your</em> house.
Every one has his own house here until he&mdash;or
she&mdash;grows up. Then they don't seem to want
to come back. They're funny people, these
grown-ups. I often wonder whether it's wearing
trousers and long skirts that makes such a
difference to them."</p>

<p>This was quite a long speech for Alexander,
so he put his head down on his paws and fell
fast asleep.</p>

<p>George wanted to ask ever so many more
questions, but all of a sudden he felt sleepy too,
so he climbed the stairs to the dear little bedroom,
lay down on the bed, and fell fast asleep.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Sir Tristram</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T must be very queer living in a country
where everything happens in a topsy-turvy
kind of way. For one thing, there would
be no time to get dull. You cannot help feeling
a little bit excited if you never know from one
minute to another what o'clock it is, where you
are, whether you are going to have your dinner
or not, and, if you go out for a walk, what
strange people you are likely to meet.</p>

<p>George thought about all these things when
he woke up. It must have been morning, for it
was quite light, and the sun was shining away
as it always seemed to shine in this country.
Did it ever rain here? If it did, it must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
been quite a nice, gentle kind of rain&mdash;baby
showers, not the kind that pours and pours and
keeps you waiting with your nose flattened to
the window-pane, wishing that it would clear
up. It never does&mdash;until bed-time.</p>

<p>The night-time is the proper time for the rain,
only what would the people do then who sell
umbrellas? Fancy a world without umbrellas!</p>

<p>If it ever did rain here, what on earth would
the giant do? He would probably catch a
dreadful cold, and then, if he began to sneeze,
he would blow the roof off one's house! It
would be much worse than the worst thunder-storm.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody ever heard of a giant with
an umbrella. If it were open, it would darken
the whole sky worse than a fog, and fogs are bad
enough.</p>

<p>George had now been quite a long time in
this country; one, two&mdash;well, it was no use
counting, for perhaps even numbers weren't the
same. It would be very difficult to remember
things if the twice-times-two table were turned
upside down. Try it and see for yourself!</p>

<p>Still, though many wonderful things had
happened, he had not found his fortune; at
least&mdash;well, there again, those leaves in the sack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
which Alexander had told him not to throw
away must be worth <em>something</em>, or what was the
use of keeping them?</p>

<p>There was no postman either. How was he
to write to Mother?&mdash;though, after all, George
wasn't quite sure if he could write a long letter
without any mistakes in spelling. Perhaps
there wasn't any spelling in this country. If
that were true it would be more delightful than
ever.</p>

<p>Suddenly, "<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>" he heard Alexander's
bark! "I'm coming!" he cried, and
jumped out of bed. He never could remember
whether he had undressed or not when he went
to bed. Anyway, his clothes were on&mdash;but were
they his clothes? Of course they were not!</p>

<p>He was dressed in a suit of brown and green,
brown the colour of the sweet-smelling earth
and green the colour of the soft grass. A little
cloak of the same colours lay neatly folded on
the chair beside his bed, and a cap with a long
golden feather hung from a peg on the wall.</p>

<p>How pleased George did feel with himself
when he looked in the glass! "I can go and
visit the king in this suit," he thought to himself.
"I suppose there <em>is</em> a king in this country.
Oh, there's sure to be one somewhere about in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
castle, and perhaps there will be a little prince
as well."</p>

<p>He went downstairs, two steps at a time.
Breakfast was laid as usual, and through the
window he could see Alexander lying at full
length licking his lips, so he had eaten his bone
or whatever else it may have been.</p>

<p>Breakfast was soon over, and George was
ready once more for all sorts of adventures. He
went out into the garden, but lo and behold,
Alexander had disappeared!</p>

<p>He whistled and called for some time, but it
was all of no use. Alexander had gone off to
look for adventures himself, and would be sure
to return by and by.</p>

<p>The little golden cock was turning round in
the breeze, but although George waited for some
time, hoping that he would fly down to earth
again, it was all in vain.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must go out by myself this
morning," thought George. "I'll just go
straight on as usual until I find a road to
somewhere. It's sure to be all right."</p>

<p>He went off toward the wood and turned
down the first path he saw. It went straight
ahead, for a wonder, and after some time he
saw, sure enough, a little sign-post.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>Written on it in large letters, so that it was
easy enough even for small boys to read, was:</p>

<p class="center">TO THE CASTLE OF THE THOUSAND TOWERS</p>

<p>"I say!" said George. "A thousand towers!
Why, that's ten times one hundred! Whoever
lives in a castle like that, I wonder."</p>

<p>He lost no time in running on, until he
found himself on a broad white road which
seemed to stretch for miles and miles ahead as
far as he could see. He stood still for a moment,
thinking of the best plan for travelling such a
long distance. Suddenly he heard a <em>Jingle,
jingle! Trot, trot!</em> and there, coming toward
him out of another part of the wood, was a
knight on horseback.</p>

<p>George knew he was a knight, because he had
often seen pictures of knights in the olden days,
clad in armour, with long plumes flowing from
their helmets.</p>

<p>This knight might have stepped out of a
picture-book. He wore a great sword at his
side, and carried a long spear with a sharp
point. When he saw George he pulled up his
horse and spoke in a kindly voice: "Well, my
young squire, and whither are you bound?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>George took off his cap. "If you please, I am
going to the Castle of a Thousand Towers. Can
you tell me if it is very far away?"</p>

<p>The knight looked down at him and smiled.
"How many miles to Babylon?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, that's in the nursery-rhyme book!"
cried George.</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied the knight. "It's sure to be
true, then. Nothing like a good rhyme, is
there? I'm bound in the same direction, so you
had better get up behind me and we can travel
together."</p>

<p>He bent down and lifted George into the
saddle, and off they went.</p>

<p>"I suppose this is a real war-horse&mdash;what the
books call a charger, isn't it?" asked George,
holding on tight.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," replied the knight. "He's
the finest horse in the land. He can carry me
for days and days and never tire."</p>

<p>"Do you really ride for days and days on
horseback, seeking adventure?" George felt
quite excited at the thought.</p>

<p>"Yes. You can't be a knight, you know,
unless you seek adventures. I'm looking for
dragons at present. You haven't seen one hereabouts,
have you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>George was silent for a moment. What was
he to say? If he told the knight about his
friend the dragon something horrid was sure to
happen, and he was such a friendly dragon too!</p>

<p>At last he said: "I don't expect there are any
dragons near here; not any <em>dangerous</em> dragons,
I mean. Some dragons are quite friendly, you
know."</p>

<p>The knight laughed. "Dragons are meant to
be killed. They're always doing wicked things&mdash;carrying
off beautiful princesses or breathing
fire and burning up whole villages. I don't call
<em>that</em> very friendly, do you?"</p>

<p>After this they rode on for some time in
silence. At last George asked: "Have you
ever been to the castle?"</p>

<p>"No. I have never been in this part of the
country before. I never stay in the same place
for long. When I do I shall hang up my sword,
spear, and shield and turn my good horse out
to rest. My work will be finished then."</p>

<p>They rode on again, <em>jingle, jingle, trot, trot</em>,
along the road and across an open plain, with
not a house or a human being in sight. The
knight began to sing, first in a very low voice
as if to himself, and then louder, so that George
could hear the words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Sword, sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">Gleaming so bright,</div>
  <div class="i1">Sword, sword,</div>
  <div class="i0">Aid me in the fight.</div>
  <div class="i0">Out of the scabbard</div>
  <div class="i0">And sturdily smite!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Shield, shield,</div>

  <div class="i1">Shield, shield,</div>

  <div class="i1">Wherever I go!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Lance, lance,</div>
  <div class="i1">Steady and true,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lance, lance,</div>

  <div class="i1">Into the battle</div>
  <div class="i0">I'll charge, lance, with you!"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The horse seemed to trot in time with the
melody, and George nodded his head as he
had seen Father doing when he was listening
to Mother playing the piano after dinner.
<em>Nid, nod, nid, nod</em>&mdash;he kept on nid-nodding
until he woke up with a jerk and found that
he must have been half asleep.</p>

<p>"Look, there's the castle!" said the knight,
pointing straight in front of him.</p>

<p>There it was, sure enough! It stood all by
itself on a hill, round whose grassy sides a road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
wound and curved up to the great gates.
These gates were made of some bright metal,
and on the top of each was carved a great
crown. Whether there were really one thousand
towers or not it is impossible to say, but
there were towers everywhere, all shining like
burnished gold in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>As they drew nearer they could hear the
blare of trumpets. Presently the gates swung
open without a sound, and the trumpeters,
mounted on white horses, came riding through,
playing such stirring music that George felt
as if he wanted to wave his cap and cheer.</p>

<p>They formed up in two lines, one on each
side of the road; the knight rode through the
gates into the courtyard. Here he dismounted
and lifted George down from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Here we are at last!" he said.</p>

<p>A long flight of marble steps led up to the
entrance. The knight took George by the
hand, and up they went, ever so high, together.
At the top stood two soldiers in armour. They
saluted, and the door of the castle opened as if
by magic.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="p6"><em>At Court</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HEY found themselves in a great hall.
It was so great that they could only see
the roof by almost bending backward.
If you imagine that it was anything like the
hall at home you are greatly mistaken.</p>

<p>The floor was made of shining wood, and
marble pillars of different colours towered up
above them to the great glass-domed roof. It
would take a whole week to tell you all the
wonders there were to be seen. Pictures of
kings and queens, of knights in armour and
lovely ladies; mirrors, fountains full of goldfish,
cages full of singing-birds&mdash;all the riches of the
world seemed to be here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>The two walked on hand in hand for a long
way without meeting a single person, and George
was just going to ask if anybody lived there
when from behind a curtain there came toward
them a man clad in scarlet and gold, carrying
a long white wand in his hand. He bowed
solemnly and, holding back the curtain, said:
"The King, my master, bids you welcome. Be
pleased to enter and refresh yourselves after
your journey."</p>

<p>He stood on one side to let them pass through
into the dining-room, where a meal was already
laid. After taking off his armour the knight sat
down, looking as if he were quite accustomed to
dining in castles. He told George later on that
kings always expected you to eat and drink
directly you arrived, and were very vexed if
you didn't.</p>

<p>"I don't think people can go and dine with
our King like this," said George, "but I expect
that's because there are no knights. At least,
I haven't heard of any."</p>

<p>"I expect you would find them if you knew
where to look for them," replied his friend.</p>

<p>"There used to be knights in King Arthur's
time," said George. "Mother reads to me all
about the Round Table out of a book at home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
There was Sir Launcelot and Galahad; and oh,
please, would you mind telling me your name?
Mine is George."</p>

<p>"A very good name too. My name&mdash;but I
cannot tell you that yet awhile. I am on a
quest, and my real name I may not tell."</p>

<p>George gazed at him. "I think you look
like Sir Tristram. May I call you by that name,
please?"</p>

<p>The knight smiled. "'Tis a great name, and
a great knight bore it; so, if it please you,
Tristram I will be to you, but to you alone."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's a secret between ourselves then!...
Will you take me with you on your quest?"</p>

<p>"You are full young to be a squire, but you
too are in search of adventure, are you not?"
asked Sir Tristram.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm seeking my fortune," replied
George.</p>

<p>"I expect it's not far off. We will look for
it together," and the knight smiled kindly.</p>

<p>Then they set to work and ate all the good
things which had been provided for them. The
gentleman in scarlet and gold&mdash;who, Sir Tristram
told George in a whisper, was the chamberlain&mdash;reappeared,
and bowing solemnly, said: "The
King hopes that you are feeling refreshed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
from your journey, and wishes to hear of your
adventures." He then turned and led the way
through another door.</p>

<p>They followed him down a long passage and
found themselves in the presence of the King.
He was standing quite alone and without his
crown on, but you could see that he was a <em>real</em>
king. He bade them welcome and listened
attentively while Sir Tristram related his
adventures.</p>

<p>"And you, young squire?" he said, turning
with a smile to George. "Are you, too, following
a quest?"</p>

<p>"I am seeking my fortune, your Majesty,"
replied George.</p>

<p>The King was silent for a while, as if in
thought.</p>

<p>The windows of the room looked out upon a
fair country of great forests, fields of waving
corn, and hills covered with vineyards. George
thought that it would be a splendid place to
come to for the summer holidays.</p>

<p>"To-night," said the King, "I hold my court,
and all those who seek their fortunes or are
looking for adventure are welcome. I shall hope
to see you both," and with a kindly nod he bade
them farewell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>George dined again with Sir Tristram, and
the dinner was delicious. He wondered what
was going to happen, but didn't like to ask any
questions. He felt just a little bit lonely, too,
without Alexander.</p>

<p>After dinner was over the chamberlain led
them down the hall and up a great staircase,
so wide that eight people abreast could have
walked up it. He paused for a moment before
two folding doors, over which hung thick
curtains edged with gold embroidery, and then,
bowing low, said: "I pray you enter."</p>

<p>The doors flew open and the two friends
entered. They found themselves in a great
room ablaze with light, but without a single
person in it. Suddenly George caught sight
of the King sitting on a throne at the far end
of the room. He looked so lonely and tired
that George felt ever so sorry for him.</p>

<p>At the foot of the throne stood two trumpeters,
who played delightful music as George and
Sir Tristram stepped toward the King and
bowed low.</p>

<p>"Welcome!" said the King. "Welcome! Ye
seek adventure, noble knight and squire, in
which to gain renown for your arms. Here
ye will find adventure enough for the bravest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>He bade them be seated, and then he spoke
as follows:</p>

<p>"Many years ago, when my father reigned
over this country, there lived a mighty magician.
He was very rich, much richer than my
father, and very proud. His wife was dead, and
he lived with an only daughter, who was said
to be very beautiful but <em>very</em> bad-tempered.</p>

<p>"My father had never seen them, but my
grandfather had often told him that this
magician, who was called Xystipos, might
come to pay a visit as soon as his daughter
was fully grown up.</p>

<p>"But alas! there came a great sickness, and
my father and mother both died and left me
to reign alone.</p>

<p>"Now there lived in a country not far from
here a princess, the daughter of my father's
old friend the king of that country. Both
her parents and my parents wished us to
marry, and indeed we were both willing, for
we loved one another.</p>

<p>"When I became King I paid a visit to
their country, and the marriage was then
arranged to take place in a few weeks.</p>

<p>"But shortly after my return a messenger
arrived who announced that Xystipos was on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
way to pay me a visit. He arrived the next day.
Nobody saw him enter the castle, or knew how
he had travelled such a great distance.</p>

<p>"He was a tall, dark man, with a long black
beard and eyes which glowed like fire. His
voice was deep and mysterious. He spoke
but seldom, and seemed as if he could read
one's very thoughts.</p>

<p>"I wondered why he had come, until one
day he said to me: 'Why have you not
married? This country needs a queen.'</p>

<p>"I told him that I was soon to marry the
Princess Fortunata, to which he replied: 'No,
that will never do. She is too young, too poor.
You need a wife who is rich, beautiful, wise.
Such a maid is my daughter. Marry her, and
you shall be the richest and most powerful
king in this land.' He smiled a smile that
made me shiver with fear.</p>

<p>"'I cannot!' I cried. 'I love the Princess
Fortunata!'</p>

<p>"He smiled again and said no more.</p>

<p>"But the next day, and every day for a week,
he asked me to marry his daughter. I told
him each time that it was quite impossible.</p>

<p>"At last he said: 'I return now to my home.
You <em>shall</em> marry my daughter in the end whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
you like it or not. Farewell!' He was gone
before I could say a word in reply.</p>

<p>"Now on the very day on which the Princess
and I were to be married there arose a great
storm, and darkness fell over the whole city.
When the sky grew clear again the Princess
had vanished. Although we searched high
and low, nobody could find her.</p>

<p>"I returned at last to my home, miserable
and heart-broken. There I found a letter from
Xystipos. No one knew how it had come. In
it was written: 'If you would win back your
Princess, you must seek and find her.' That
was all."</p>

<p class="p6"><em>The Quest Begins</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">"T</span>HAT happened five years ago," continued
the King, "and from that day
to this I have never been able to find
out where the magician lives. I fear that
Fortunata is lost for ever!"</p>

<p>Sir Tristram knelt before the King. "Grant
me this quest, I pray you, sire!"</p>

<p>The King sat in silence for a moment. "Be
it so!" he replied. "But I fear you little know
the dangers and the trials which await you.
Arms and money I can provide, but in no other
way can I help you. If you succeed, then ask
of me what you will and it is yours. Many
have set out on this quest, but none return.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Now my court is deserted, for a sad king has but
few friends."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a clear, sunny morning. Sir Tristram
and George were already upon their way to seek
the enchanted Princess.</p>

<p>George was riding&mdash;actually riding!&mdash;upon a
beautiful pony which the King had given him.
You may imagine how proud he felt!</p>

<p>In which direction should they go? Sir
Tristram and he talked it over, and, as it did
not matter very much, they rode down the
hill and out on to the plain, hoping by and
by to come upon a good road to somewhere.</p>

<p>"It will be all right," said George. "On
we go!"</p>

<p>He had scarcely said this when he caught
sight of a little weathercock perched up on the
top of a house roof. To be sure! His friend
the weathercock had told him to ask any of
his family he might meet to show him the way.</p>

<p>This weathercock was pointing straight down
a long road across the plain, and when George
told Sir Tristram this he nodded his head and
said: "'Tis well! The weathercock knows the
way better than we do."</p>

<p>They rode and rode until at last they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to a great forest. And now a dreadful thing
happened, for when they were right in the
middle of it they lost their way.</p>

<p>Sir Tristram dismounted. "Let us eat and then
rest awhile. We shall find our way by and by.
Here the adventure begins, young squire."</p>

<p>So they sat down under a great tree and ate
and drank. After they had finished their meal
Sir Tristram took off some of his armour and
lay down on the soft mossy bank. After a time
he fell asleep.</p>

<p>George nearly fell asleep too. He felt only
half awake, and lay on his back listening to
the sighing of the wind in the trees and the
twittering of the birds. Sometimes it sounded
as if they were talking to one another, and
sometimes as if they were laughing. Who ever
heard birds laugh?</p>

<p>He felt in his pocket for his knife, as he
wanted to try to make a whistle out of a piece
of wood as Father did. In one pocket he found
nothing and in the other some leaves, which he
took out to throw away.</p>

<p>"Why, these must be Tom Tiddler's leaves!"
he thought. "Alexander said that I wasn't
to throw them away. I'll put one of them in
my cap."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>He fixed one carefully in the side of his cap,
and put the others back in his pocket. Then,
all of a sudden, he seemed to hear voices,
quite tiny voices, talking high up in the air
above him.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said the first voice, "it <em>is</em> a long way
to the magician's castle."</p>

<p>George sat up and listened eagerly.</p>

<p>"Nobody has ever found the way there yet,"
said the second voice.</p>

<p>"That's because they are so stupid," was the
reply. "You must follow the sun until it sinks,
and then follow it again when it rises, until you
arrive."</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed another voice. "First
of all you must cross the black lake, and that is
impossible."</p>

<p>"Then there is the glass mountain to climb,"
cried a fourth voice. "That's <em>ever</em> so slippery,
you know!"</p>

<p>"And then there are the two guardians of
the gate. Nobody ever passed <em>them</em> alive!"
The fifth voice said this.</p>

<p>"And even if you get into the castle, that's
no use, for it is enchanted ground," said a
squeaky voice. "You have to know the magic
word, and nobody knows that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pooh! Rubbish!" answered a great big
voice. "The weathercock who sits on the very
tip-top of the highest tower of the castle knows
it. But nobody has ever asked him yet."</p>

<p>Then the voices were silent. George stood
up and looked all round him, but he could
see nobody. As he looked up into the trees a
few birds flew away, and then there was silence
in the forest.</p>

<p>"Well, we know the way to the castle now,"
he thought. "Oh, <em>what</em> an adventure it's going
to be! Won't Alexander be sorry that he
missed it!"</p>

<p class="p6"><em>The Giant Again</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">S</span>IR TRISTRAM and George journeyed
onward, following the sun through the
great forest. At last they came into open
country, and found themselves on a rocky road
which dipped down-hill as if it never meant to
stop. It led them into a valley, and then on
again into a deep gorge, which came to an end
on the shores of a great lake.</p>

<p>"The black lake!" cried George. "Look, it's
as black as pitch! What a horrid place!"</p>

<p>Sir Tristram dismounted and gazed around
him. "I marvel how we shall ever fare across
it. I cannot swim, and even if I could I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
leave my armour behind. The doughtiest knight
cannot fight in his doublet."</p>

<p>George looked out on to the waters of the
lake, but it was so wide that he could not see
the other side. High above his head towered
rugged cliffs as black as the waters of the lake,
and in the distance he caught sight of a mighty
pillar standing erect on the summit.</p>

<p>He looked again. "I do believe it's the old
giant!" he cried.</p>

<p>"A giant!"&mdash;and in a moment Sir Tristram
was on his feet and had drawn his mighty
two-handed sword.</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>please</em>, don't!" implored George. "He's
a friend of mine. He's quite a good giant. He
wouldn't harm anybody."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" asked Sir Tristram. "A
good giant?... Still, if you know him I must
take your word for it."</p>

<p>"<em>Coo-ee!</em>" cried George. "<em>Coo-ee!</em>" His
voice echoed against the rocky walls as if a
hundred voices were all crying "<em>Coo-ee!</em>"
together.</p>

<p>The pillar moved, stopped for a moment, and
then moved on again, and then&mdash;<em>plop!</em>&mdash;into
the lake went one of the giant's feet, and then
<em>plop!</em> went the other. He was now in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
water right up to his neck, so you can tell from
that how deep it was!</p>

<p>"Good-evening!" rumbled his great voice.
"I've been waiting for you ever so long. You
want to cross the lake, I suppose? Come along
then!" And he stretched out his huge hand.</p>

<p>"Come along, Sir Tristram!" commanded
George. "It's all right. There's heaps of
room on his hand for both the horses and
ourselves."</p>

<p>They led the horses on to his outstretched
hand, and without another word the giant began
to wade across the lake. On and on he went
until they lost sight of the shore; on and on
until the water began to grow shallower again.
After an hour's journey they arrived, and the
giant lowered them gently on to dry land.</p>

<p>"I must go for a run to dry myself," he said,
and in one&mdash;two&mdash;three tremendous strides he
was out of sight.</p>

<p>Sir Tristram leant on his sword. "In faith,
he is a mighty giant. I fear me that even my
trusty blade would be of little avail against
him."</p>

<p>George smiled. "Oh no! He's fearfully
strong, but he's very kind, although he does tell
very long stories."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Stories?" asked Sir Tristram. He had
hardly spoken when the giant was at their side
again.</p>

<p>"I'm <em>quite</em> dry now!" he roared. He seemed
to be very pleased with himself, and smiled a
huge smile as he asked: "Did I hear you saying
that you wanted to hear a story? Wait a
minute!"&mdash;and before they guessed what he was
about he was lying on the ground with his head
close up to them.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's going to be <em>very</em> long,"
whispered George to Sir Tristram, who sat with
his sword between his knees, gazing at the giant
in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Well, once upon a time there was a
prince&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Had he a sausage?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Yes. How did you know?... Oh, I must
have told you that story before. It doesn't
matter, for I never tell it twice in the same way.
My stories are always changing; the older they
are the longer they grow."</p>

<p>George sighed. "Oh dear! This is going
to be a dreadfully long story. Never mind; I
missed most of it the last time, and perhaps he'll
go to sleep again."</p>

<p>The giant continued: "Now this prince was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
very rich. He had twenty castles, each with
two hundred rooms, and a bicycle."</p>

<p>"A bicycle? That's nothing!" said George.
"I'm going to have a bicycle myself."</p>

<p>"Don't interrupt!" grumbled the giant.
"This was a special bicycle. It had twenty-five
wheels."</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't be a bicycle, then. A
bicycle has only two wheels," cried George.</p>

<p>"What was it, then, if it wasn't a bicycle?"</p>

<p>George thought for a moment. "I don't
know," he replied.</p>

<p>"There you are! You don't know. Of
<em>course</em> it was a bicycle. I've told this story,
oh, hundreds of times, and I've always called
it a bicycle. That's a sure proof!" The giant
smiled triumphantly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon for interrupting you,"
said George politely.</p>

<p>"Not at all. You see, you know now what a
bicycle is. You didn't before I told you....
Well, this prince went out one day on his bicycle
to hunt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Tristram looked quite startled. "To
hunt?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, to hunt. Princes always go out hunting....
Well, he hunted and he hunted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
he hunted for weeks and weeks and weeks...."
Here the giant paused. "Oh, I forgot. She
said I was not to delay you by telling stories.
So you'd better be going on your way."</p>

<p>"Did She send you here?" asked George,
who knew what the giant meant.</p>

<p>"What a lot of questions you ask! Hurry
up or you'll be late." And without another
word the giant rose, stepped over a high
mountain which stood in his way, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Come along, Sir Tristram!" said George,
"I'll tell you all about it as we ride along."</p>

<p class="p6"><em>The Arrival at the Castle</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">I</span>T was the end of the third day when at
last the two travellers espied a hill rising
out of the plain. It shone and glittered
as if it were made of diamonds, so they guessed
that this must be the rays of the sun shining
on the glass hill where the magician lived.</p>

<p>As they came closer they could see that the
hill was very high and steep, and that there
was no road leading up to the castle on the
top.</p>

<p>"We can never win to the summit of that
hill," said Sir Tristram in a melancholy voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, it will be all right. She knows all
about it. She sent the giant to help us over
the black lake, I'm sure," said George cheerfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
But he certainly did not like the hill at all. It
was steeper than a switchback, and you know
how steep that is!</p>

<p>At last they arrived at the foot of the hill.
It was so slippery that their horses stumbled
and nearly fell at the first step.</p>

<p>"That's no good," said George. "We must
just sit down and wait."</p>

<p>They dismounted and waited. Nothing happened
for a long time. "I <em>do</em> wish She were
here!" sighed George.</p>

<p>There was a <em>whizz!</em> overhead, and down
swooped the witch on her broomstick.</p>

<p>"What a long time it takes for little boys
to learn to ask nicely for what they want,"
she said, with a smile. "Jump up! You can
leave your horses behind. They will look after
themselves."</p>

<p>Up they climbed without delay, for Sir
Tristram was too astonished to say a single
word.</p>

<p><em>Whizz!</em>&mdash;off they went again. Up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;and
then, in the twinkling of an eye,
there they were on top!</p>

<p>"Here we are!" said the witch. "Off you
get! I expect we shall meet again before long.
Don't forget to ask for what you want"&mdash;and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
with a smile which was more crooked than ever,
she disappeared.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"This is indeed a mighty adventure," said
Sir Tristram. "See, yonder lies the magician's
castle!"</p>

<p>George looked in the direction in which the
knight pointed, and there was indeed the
strangest castle he had ever seen. It was built
of polished glass, and all the windows looked
like great wide-open eyes which were staring at
them. The gates were made of brass in the
shape of letters of the alphabet, all mixed up
together.</p>

<p>On the top of the highest tower stood a
weathercock, a fierce-looking bird with green
eyes and a long black beak. But fiercer still
looked the two guardians of the gate. These
were two enormous dogs with two great round
eyes like blazing fires. They were almost as
large as elephants.</p>

<p>Suddenly they caught sight of the two
strangers and, opening their huge mouths, they
growled, "<em>Grrrr!</em>" It was enough to make
you shiver and shake with fear.</p>

<p>Sir Tristram drew his sword. "Methinks this
will be a great battle," he said. "Stay you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
here, and if I do not return, still I shall have
fallen as a knight should fall."</p>

<p>"No, no!" cried George. "Don't you remember
what the witch told me? I must ask
for what I want. I want the dragon!... Oh,
look!" and there, sure enough, in front of them
was his old friend the dragon, blinking his eyes
and wagging his tail.</p>

<p>"I thought you would want me before long,
George," he said. "Do tell that friend of yours
to put away his sword. It looks dreadfully
sharp, and I never did like swords. It isn't
any good here, for you are on enchanted ground.
Just let me get my breath, and I'll soon finish
this business."</p>

<p>He lay there and panted, while the two
great dogs growled and growled worse than
ever.</p>

<p>"Nasty beasts!" said the dragon. "I mustn't
go too close to them or else they might bite me.
I'll give them a taste of something they won't
like."</p>

<p>He began to crawl toward the dogs very
slowly, and when he was within a few yards of
them his mouth opened wide like a great pit,
and out shot a tremendous flame. <em>One! Two!</em></p>

<p>George rubbed his eyes. The dragon was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
lying there licking his scales, but the dogs had
disappeared. Two small heaps of white ashes lay
in the place where they had been.</p>

<p>"That's all right!" said the dragon. "Now
you can walk in, but don't forget the password."</p>

<p class="p6"><em>What the Weathercock Said</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE password&mdash;what could it be? George
puzzled and puzzled until he almost grew
dizzy with thinking, but no, he couldn't
remember. Then, at last&mdash;of course! The
weathercock on top of the castle knew. He
remembered the voices which he had heard
talking in the forest and what they had said.</p>

<p>But how could he get the weathercock to tell
him? He whistled and called, but all in vain.
Nothing whatever happened.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the thought came into his
head: "Why, those voices I heard in the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
must have been birds talking.... Why didn't
I hear them before that day?... They must
have been magic birds ... perhaps fairies?...
Oh, I wonder if Tom Tiddler's leaves had anything
to do with it? I know I put one in my
cap.... Where is my cap?"</p>

<p>He bent down and picked it up from the
ground. The leaf was still where he had placed
it. He placed it on his head, and then, looking
up at the weathercock, cried "<em>Coo-ee!</em>"</p>

<p>The cock turned round slowly and, fixing
its green eye upon George, asked: "Who
calls?"</p>

<p>"A friend!" George thought this was quite
the right thing to say. It was the answer to
the sentry's "Who goes there?" He felt that
as he was squire to a knight it was as good as
being a soldier.</p>

<p>The cock went on turning. At last: "You're
George, aren't you?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied George. "I met your brother
not so long ago. He lives close by my house in
the wood."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the cock, and went on turning
and turning.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't be long," thought George.
"He doesn't seem as nice as my friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want?" said a voice in his
ear.</p>

<p>He gave a jump, for there was the cock
standing by his side.</p>

<p>"I suppose you want the password? She
brought you here, so it will be all right. I must
whisper it&mdash;nobody but you may hear it." The
cock turned, whispered in George's ear, and
before you could wink an eyelid was back on top
of the castle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Where's Sir Tristram?" George looked
everywhere, but there was no sign of him.</p>

<p>At last, after he had walked quite a long
way, he caught sight of him and the dragon
actually&mdash;yes, actually fighting! He was
horrified, for the dragon was leaping, turning,
and twisting in all directions, while Sir
Tristram's sword was hissing and flashing
through the air like lightning.</p>

<p>"They'll hurt one another, I'm sure!" And
George ran as near to them as he dared, calling
out: "Stop! Oh, stop!"</p>

<p>The dragon stopped at once and called out:
"It's all right! Don't be afraid. I'm only showing
your friend one or two tricks in fighting.
We shouldn't dream of hurting one another."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is indeed a glorious dragon," said Sir
Tristram, leaning on his sword and smiling.
"Little did I think that I should ever be friends
with one. He has taught me much that I did
not know before."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you were only pretending?" George
laughed, and then said solemnly: "I've learnt
the password, but it's ever so difficult, and I'm
not to tell it to anybody else."</p>

<p>The knight did not answer him for a moment.
"I think then, young squire, it would be best
for you to go upon this quest alone. Your friend
the dragon has told me that She wishes it."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried George. "All by myself?"</p>

<p>The dragon laughed. "We'll wait here for
you, George. You came to seek your fortune,
you know, and you're not far off it now. You're
getting warm!"</p>

<p>"All right!" answered George. "If you hear
me cry '<em>Coo-ee!</em>' you must come to my help
at once. This is going to be a tremendous adventure.
Alexander doesn't know how much he
is missing. Here goes!"&mdash;and waving his hand
to the two friends, he ran off. He looked back
once and saw that they had again commenced
to play at fighting, and then he ran on again
until he came to the great gates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused for a moment to repeat the password
over to himself; then said it out aloud.
The gates swung open with a clang, and, as he
walked through, shut behind him.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Princess Fortunata</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">G</span>EORGE never was able to remember
clearly what happened in the magician's
castle. He used afterward to tell the
story in bits, and Mother put all the bits
together, little by little, just as one sews a
counterpane, until there was a whole story.
How long he was there, whether he felt afraid,
whether it was only a dream, whether it was
all magic&mdash;who knows?&mdash;and, after all, what
does it matter?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He first remembers that he was going upstairs.
Not ordinary stairs, you know, like
those in your house. No; these stairs were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
quite different. They were moving all the time.
As fast as he mounted one step, two and even
three steps moved up, so that he was always
farther and farther away from the top. He was
very puzzled for some time to know what to
do. So at last he stopped and repeated the
magic charm. Then the steps began to move in
the opposite direction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Now the steps had stopped moving, and began
to curl and wind in the most vexing manner.
Round and round they went, and round and
round went George, until he was quite giddy.</p>

<p>"These stairs are always coming back to the
same place, I declare!" he thought. "This will
never do. I shall go on climbing until this time
next year, and oh, shan't I be tired!"</p>

<p>Again he repeated the charm, and the stairs
became straight as a straight line. Up and up
he went. Would they never end?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He was at the top and standing before a door
which was closed. He turned the handle; he
pushed and pushed.... He seemed to hear
somebody laughing, and laughing in a very
disagreeable, ill-tempered way. It sounded as
if it came from inside the room, or whatever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
was behind the door. George became very
angry. He just hated anybody laughing at
him. He would show them what he could do!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He must remember to say the charm sooner
next time. But it was so difficult to remember
anything in this queer place!</p>

<p>Where was he now? There seemed to be faces&mdash;thousands
of faces&mdash;peeping at him from every
side, from every hole, and from every corner.</p>

<p>Where had he seen these faces before? He
couldn't tell, and yet he knew them.... Why,
of course! They were the reflections of his own
face in mirrors, hundreds and thousands of
mirrors! How very strange it looked! Well,
there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The mirrors grew dull and duller, and then
bright and brighter. George saw himself
wherever he looked; even the ceiling and the
floor seemed made of glass. How horrid! Even
if you were <em>very</em> good-looking you wouldn't like
to see nothing but your own face, would you?</p>

<p>There must be a door somewhere.... If he
didn't find the door soon he would become enchanted,
and that would never do.... What
had he forgotten?... Ah, the charm!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>He was standing on the bank of a great
river. It was very dark, and he could scarcely
see a foot in front of him, but he could hear
the roar of the water as it went rushing and
roaring by.</p>

<p>Was it his fancy, or were there voices mocking
him? It sounded as if they were saying something.
"<em>Ooooh! Ooooh! Ooooh! It is so-oo-oo
co-o-old! Hoo-oo! As co-old as i-ice!</em>"</p>

<p>"I can't swim a little bit," thought George.
"Even Alexander couldn't swim across this
horrible river.... I wonder if I counted 'one,
two, three!' and jumped in, whether I should
be drowned.... One ... two...."</p>

<p>Could that be Alexander's bark in the far-away
distance? "Jump in, George!" the dear
dog seemed to be saying.</p>

<p>Well, this was an adventure!... "One,
two...."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The river had disappeared. George found
himself in a most wonderful garden. The sun
was shining overhead in a blue sky, and everywhere
he looked he could see nothing but
flowers.... What a perfectly delightful scent!
The grass was so soft, too. He must just sit
down and rest for a moment....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>He began to feel very thirsty.... Why,
there were lovely pears and apples on those
trees over there. He must just pluck one!...
He felt so tired, and it was so cool sitting
in the shade. He could almost hear little
voices singing a lullaby to him....</p>

<p>What was the good of bothering about anything?
It was ever so jolly here.... Wouldn't
it be fun if Alexander were here too! What
races they would run!... No, they would
just lie down together and.... Hark! Was
that Alexander's bark once more? "Wake up!
Wake up!"</p>

<p>What a bother! But the sound kept ringing
in his ears, and slowly&mdash;oh, so slowly!&mdash;he
walked toward a little door in the garden
wall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>He was walking down a long passage, and
on each side of him were doors. He could
not make up his mind which door to open.
Never mind! It didn't matter very much.
Perhaps they weren't real, but only magic
doors. He opened the next door he came to
and walked into ... no, not a room, but just
a little space scarcely as large as a cupboard,
with a door in the wall facing him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>He opened that, and found himself facing
another door.</p>

<p>"This <em>is</em> a bother!" he thought. "Just like
a Chinese box-trick. You open one box and
then you find another inside it, and then another
inside that. They keep on getting smaller
and smaller until.... Why, this place <em>is</em> getting
smaller!"... And so it was!... He had
hardly room to move now.</p>

<p>He turned round to go back again, but
found the door shut behind him.</p>

<p>"I'll just open one more." He opened it,
and found himself in a most beautiful room,
and there, lying on a couch fast asleep, was&mdash;the
Princess Fortunata! Just like a story-book,
isn't it?</p>

<p>Now it is just here that George's story begins
to get a little patchy, like the counterpane.</p>

<p>He remembers trying to wake the Princess.
She remained fast asleep in spite of all that
he did. She was very beautiful, just like a
pink and white rose, but he could not remember
what dress she wore, or what the colour
of her hair was, or anything else at all, so you
must make up the rest of it for yourselves.</p>

<p>He woke her up at last. Did he kiss her,
like the Prince in <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
never remembered&mdash;or said that he didn't
remember. I wonder!</p>

<p>She opened her eyes and gazed at him, as
if just awakening from a dream.</p>

<p>What did she say? What do princesses say
to brave knights who rescue them from enchantment?</p>

<p>You may be sure that she said <em>just</em> the right
things. Princesses always do. They are taught
the right words to say by their governesses, in
case they might become enchanted when they
grow up. You never know what a fairy god-mother
may do, especially if she be a bad fairy!</p>

<p>Now came the hardest part of all&mdash;to escape
with the Princess from the enchanted castle.</p>

<p>The Princess took George gently by the hand
like a nice, kind, grown-up sister, and said:
"We must hasten. In another moment the
wicked magician will be here, and then we are
lost!"</p>

<p>So they ran hand in hand to the door and
down a passage. "Faster!" cried the Princess,
and George ran faster than he had ever run
before.</p>

<p>"Faster, faster!" cried the Princess again,
and on and on they sped until George wondered
if there was any end at all to the passage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly, <em>boom! boom!</em>&mdash;like the rolling of
thunder!</p>

<p>"The magician is coming! Hasten, oh,
hasten!" On and on they ran.</p>

<p><em>Boo-oom!</em> Closer and closer! Faster and
faster the two ran, until it seemed as if they
were flying through the air.</p>

<p><em>Boom!</em> It sounded almost in their very ears.
They caught sight of a little door, so tiny you
could scarcely see it, and rushed toward it;
George pulled it open, pushed the Princess
through, and was just going to follow her
when&mdash;<em>crash!</em></p>

<p class="p6"><em>Another Party</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">H</span>E was lying on a soft mossy bank,
and Alexander&mdash;yes, Alexander!&mdash;was
gently licking the tip of his nose.</p>

<p>"Wherever have you been?" he cried, sitting
up and looking at the dear, dear dog in surprise
and delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've just been having a little snooze,"
wuffed Alexander, and yawned a real doggy yawn.</p>

<p>George was so pleased that he got up and
hugged him. After Alexander had shaken
himself, for his coat was just a little ruffled up
after George's embrace, he sat down and smiled&mdash;such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
a friendly smile! Only a dog can smile
like that.</p>

<p>"Where have I been, Alexander?" asked
George.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> know, George," replied Alexander.
"Why do you ask me?"</p>

<p>"Where's the Princess?"</p>

<p>"At home, where she ought to be, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, where am I, now?"</p>

<p>"Look around you!"</p>

<p>George looked, and there, standing just in
front of him, was the little house. It felt like
coming home again.... Home? Ah, yes; but
wasn't it time to be returning to their <em>real</em>
home?</p>

<p>He got up and walked toward the house.
"I wish ... I wish my fortune were here!"
he said. "I would like to go home and see
Mother and Father again!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once more they heard the sweet music, but
louder and louder, as if it were coming toward
them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Shall I ever find my fortune, Alexander?"
said George after tea. It was tea, not breakfast,
so it must have been evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, my child; it lies right there under
your very nose."</p>

<p>"Where?" George looked down, and then
remembered. "That's what the mother said in
the dragon's story, isn't it?... Oh, dear, everything
is so puzzling! Where is Sir Tristram?
Shan't I ever see him again?"</p>

<p>"Time for bed now!" Alexander yawned
and stretched himself, and not another word
would he say.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was nice to be in bed in this cosy little
room. There were such jolly patterns on the
wall-paper, and they seemed to be changing all
the time. Sometimes there were trees and rivers,
sometimes birds and animals, sometimes ships
and whales. Perhaps it was a dream wall-paper.
Would there be another adventure to-morrow?
It would be fun to go back to the Castle of the
Thousand Towers and visit the King. Just fancy
if he invited George to stay with him! Did the
Princess get back quite safely?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What was happening?</p>

<p>The room seemed to be full of a soft rosy light.
The walls seemed to be growing and spreading
in all directions. The bed&mdash;why, it wasn't a bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
at all! It was a beautiful couch of soft moss,
and the room had disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>George was lying in the forest, in the middle
of a glade surrounded by trees of all shapes
and sizes. Music was everywhere&mdash;above him,
around him, ebbing and flowing like the tide of
the sea. Little voices were whispering, laughing,
singing; what were they saying? Could it be:
"George is home at last!"</p>

<p>Why, this wasn't home! It was ... what
was it?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thousands and thousands of tiny lights! They
came on and on, until the whole glade was lit
up as bright as day. Still there was not a soul
to be seen! What was that? "<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>"&mdash;and
there was Alexander with&mdash;a green bow
round his neck!</p>

<p>"What <em>are</em> you doing here?" cried George.</p>

<p>"I've come to your party, George," said
Alexander, and standing on his hind legs he
made a low bow. What next, I wonder?</p>

<p>George stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ah, here are some old friends coming!"
And Alexander bounded away as if he thought
George understood what he meant. Some old
friends?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>A blast of trumpets, and lines of trumpeters
marched two by two into the glade. They
formed into two lines, and then down the middle
there came the King and his Princess&mdash;now his
Queen&mdash;wearing their royal robes and their
crowns! They looked perfectly splendid! With
them was Sir Tristram in full armour.</p>

<p>They walked up to George and shook hands
with him. "Thank you so much for inviting us
to your party," said the Queen, with a heavenly
smile. "I haven't been to a party for ages and
ages. I am so glad we are not late. What a
sweet spot you have chosen for the entertainment."</p>

<p>The entertainment? What did she mean, or
was it one of Alexander's jokes?</p>

<p>A <em>whirr, whirr</em>, and there in the middle of
the glade was the witch.</p>

<p>"Well, George!" she said, with a smile. "You
look surprised to see me. You did invite me,
you know, so I'm not a rude old witch, whatever
you may think. The giant's coming too. He
stopped to tell the storks a story, but he'll
arrive in time for supper."</p>

<p>Supper? So there was going to be a supper!</p>

<p>The dragon was the next guest to appear.
He and the weathercock came&mdash;not arm in arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
but&mdash;well, you know what one means by arm
in arm when dragons are walking. They were
both very pleased to see George, and the dragon
was full of jokes and fun.</p>

<p>Last of all came Tom Tiddler, helping old
Father Time along, and then Alexander with
his two friends the cats.</p>

<p>"Are we all here?" asked the witch. "We
can't wait for the giant. He's always late.
Let's begin!"</p>

<p>They seated themselves in a circle round
George, and all looked at him as if they were
expecting something.</p>

<p>"Now then, George!" said the witch. "We
are waiting to hear all about your fortune."</p>

<p>Everybody clapped their hands&mdash;not the
dragon, the weathercock, and those without
hands&mdash;and cried: "Bravo! Bravo!"</p>

<p>George felt very shy. "It's a long story," he
began.</p>

<p>"All stories are long; all <em>good</em> stories," said a
voice, and there was the giant peeping at them
from behind the trees!</p>

<p>"It's all right," he explained. "I'm lying
down, so I shan't be in anybody's way."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So George told them his story&mdash;all that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
have read in these pages, and everybody
listened, and now and then told a little bit
themselves when it came to the part which they
knew.</p>

<p>At last they came to the end. "And so they
married and lived happily ever after!" said the
Queen, with a smile.</p>

<p>George jumped to his feet and clapped his
hands. "I told you I was right!" he cried to
the giant. "All stories end in that way."</p>

<p>"Ah, but <em>your</em> story isn't finished, so I shall
be right," said the giant. "You're not married,
you know. Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Stop laughing at once!" ordered the witch.
"You'll curdle all the cream if you're not careful.
Laugh down in your boots and then it
won't matter."</p>

<p>"I can't," replied the giant. "I've tried, oh,
ever so hard, and it always comes out the wrong
way. Whatever I do is wrong."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, don't cry!" begged George.
"I'm sure you did try. It must be difficult to
remember that you are a giant."</p>

<p>"It's a long, long way to my boots," said the
giant. "I expect the laughter gets tired about
half-way, and bursts. Then, you know, it's no
good. When your laughter bursts it flies out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
your mouth before you know where you are. I
remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are <em>not</em> to remember," commanded the
witch. "It's time for supper."</p>

<p>She waved her stick, and in a flash there was
the supper all ready laid. What a pity that all
suppers can't be arranged as easily as this!</p>

<p>Well, they ate and they drank, and all the
time sweet music was played by invisible
musicians. It was far, far finer than George's
last birthday-party.</p>

<p>After supper everybody&mdash;except the giant&mdash;told
stories or sang songs, and Alexander
showed them how dogs signal to one another by
tail-wagging.</p>

<p>Then there was a moment's silence. Old
Father Time arose and said: "I must go on
my way once more. It is now time to say
farewell."</p>

<p>"Stop a minute!" cried Tom Tiddler. "We
must give George a present. Each one of us
must give him something as a remembrance&mdash;or
else he might forget us!"</p>

<p>He put his hand in his pocket, drew something
out and presented it to George. It was
a leaf!</p>

<p>"A leaf for remembrance! George will find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
out what it means by and by," he said, with a
smile. "Now then, it's somebody else's turn."</p>

<p>Each in turn shook hands with George and
gave him a present. Now, what did they give?</p>

<p>Last of all came the beautiful Queen. With
a radiant smile she took George in her arms
and kissed him. It was just like being kissed
by sweet roses, honeysuckle, and all the fragrant
flowers you can think of!</p>

<p>"I have given him the best present of all,"
she said. "For his end to the story is really
the sweetest; 'they lived happily ever after.'
George is a fairy boy, after all, aren't you,
George?"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How madly the music was playing! <em>Tum-tee-rum-tee-tiddle-tee-tum!</em>
Almost as if one
ought to dance to it. Yes, he would dance
with the beautiful Queen!</p>

<p>He opened his eyes&mdash;but where was everybody?
Gone, all gone!</p>

<p>Around him were hundreds and hundreds
of tiny figures dancing, singing, flying through
the air. Many of them were wearing green
jackets and red caps and were playing&mdash;ah,
the music&mdash;the same sweet melody he had heard
so often!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>Could they be&mdash;the fairies?</p>

<p>Where was he? He seemed to be moving
along. He was actually in a carriage which
was being dragged along by any number of
these tiny people. On the box sat a little
figure&mdash;could it be Tom Tiddler? He guessed
all in a flash it was&mdash;of course, you've guessed
it too&mdash;Puck.</p>

<p>Puck turned round and smiled at George.
"Home! We're going home now. Mother
wants you. Mind you don't forget your fortune,
George!"</p>

<p>On they drove; through the wood with the
moon shining down on them above the trees;
down the hill past the windmill, which made
George think of the young dragon who went
to look for his fortune; and into the garden.
Home at last! Alexander met them at the
gate.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, George!" he wuffed.
"Hasn't it been an adventure?"</p>

<p>George sat up straight in the carriage as if
he had been a prince or a victorious general
coming home from the war. At last the
carriage stopped.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption"><p>AROUND HIM WERE HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

</div>

<p>Then George, who felt as if he had been
in a dream, turned to the fairies and said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
"I <em>am</em> pleased to be home again. Thank you
so much for bringing me all this way. I have
enjoyed myself, oh, ever so much!"</p>

<p>Puck took off his cap and bowed. "You're
here: you might be there, but you're not. Now
you know <em>all</em> about it!"</p>

<p>"Why, Tom Tiddler said that!" cried George.</p>

<p>Before he could say another word the fairies
were all flying away in the air. <em>Tinkle, tinkle!</em>&mdash;you
should have heard their tiny laughter!</p>

<p>Puck smiled: "Don't forget us, little George!
Don't forget us! You are a fairy boy, after
all, aren't you?" and in an instant&mdash;<em>whish!</em>&mdash;he
was gone!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"George, darling!" Who was that calling
him? Could it be Mother?</p>

<p>What a long time he must have kept her
waiting!</p>

<p class="p6"><em>Back to the World</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">"G</span>EORGE, darling!" George rubbed his
eyes. Ah, it was the beautiful Queen
kissing him again.</p>

<p>"George!" Ah, it was the witch this time.
He knew <em>her</em> voice well enough. She must have
come back again. It felt like a dream, but
there were dreams within dreams, and he didn't
really know which was the true dream. He
must be back in his little house again ... but
hadn't the fairies brought him home? The
fairies? Then had he been dreaming about
these adventures, and, if so, where was he now?
There were really fairies, anyway; he was quite
sure about that!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>And so he went on thinking and thinking,
although the voice, such a sweet voice, kept
repeating "George, darling!"</p>

<p>What was that? Alexander's bark!   "<em>Wuff!
Wuff!</em>" That was all right. Alexander would
explain everything.</p>

<p>"<em>Wuff! Wuff!</em>" right in his ear. He sat
up with a start.</p>

<p>Why, he was in bed in his own room! There
was Alexander sitting with his head a little on
one side looking at him, and thump-thumping
with his tail on the bed-clothes.</p>

<p>And there were the beautiful Queen and the
witch ... no, it wasn't ... it was Mother
bending over him and saying "George, darling!"
and there was Nurse sitting knitting. How odd!</p>

<p>"You <em>have</em> been sound asleep, dear. It was
Alexander who woke you up at last," said
Mother. Nurse said nothing, but she smiled
such a peculiar smile. Where had George seen
that smile before? Could Nurse be a witch?</p>

<p>His head was so full of all his wonderful
adventures that he wanted to begin to tell them
all about it at once. But Mother said "No!"
and Nurse said "No!" and Alexander said
nothing, but just lay on the bed and smiled all
the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, it <em>was</em> annoying! Every time he began
his story Mother said: "George, dear, you
mustn't get so excited," and Nurse said: "Time
for your medicine!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The doctor arrived in his little motor, <em>puff-puffing</em>
away as hard as ever.</p>

<p>"Well, how are we to-day?" he said. "Feeling
a little better, eh?"</p>

<p>"I'm all right," answered George. "I want
to get up and go out with Alexander!"</p>

<p>"H'm! You weren't so well after you had
been out yesterday, you know. You should take
care of yourself." And the doctor bent over
him, felt his pulse, looked at his tongue, and
did all the tiresome things doctors do when we
aren't well.</p>

<p>"He really seems much better. In fact, you
can let him go for a walk so long as he doesn't
overheat himself," George heard him say to
Mother.</p>

<p>"Doctor!" called George, just as the doctor
was getting ready to go. "Doctor, come here!"
And as the doctor came up to the bedside he
whispered in his ear: "I've been there!"</p>

<p>"Been there?" The doctor was puzzled.</p>

<p>"Yes. You remember my asking you if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
was a real Fairyland, and you said that if I
really wanted to find the way there I must wish
as hard as ever I could. Well, I've been there,
and oh, I've had <em>such</em> adventures!"</p>

<p>The doctor smiled. "How many miles to
Babylon?" he asked.</p>

<p>Now <em>who</em> had said that to George before?
Why, it was Sir Tristram! Wasn't it queer that
the doctor should say it too?</p>

<p>"Lucky boy!" said the doctor, taking up his
hat again. "Lucky boy! We grown-ups have
no luck at all. I lose my way every time I try
to get there."</p>

<p>"What a pity!" cried George. "I'm sure
your house is ready waiting there for you."</p>

<p>"Well, well," replied the doctor. "See that
it's kept well aired for me when you're there
next time, won't you? I <em>might</em> manage to get
there some time, if only by accident."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It took George days and days to tell his story
properly. Mother was never tired of hearing
it, and asked heaps and heaps of questions;
Father said the mere thought of a real live
dragon, and especially a wicked magician, made
him shiver and shake. He really did shake all
over, but perhaps he was only pretending.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>Nurse nodded her head very wisely, but
though George asked her if she had ever seen
a witch, no, she wouldn't answer anything but:
"Perhaps I have; perhaps I haven't."</p>

<p>Uncle William was delighted to hear that
Alexander could talk, and used to read him bits
out of the newspaper and ask him what he
thought about the weather, and all kinds of
nonsense. He loved the part about Tom
Tiddler, and really could imitate his voice so
well that George sometimes couldn't tell the
difference.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>George often talked to Mother about his little
house in the wood. One day when they were
sitting in the garden he said to her: "You have
a house there too, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have a little house," replied Mother.
"I have been back to it quite lately. I sometimes
forget about it for a time, but I always
like to go back to it when I am feeling a
little tired or cross. It is so nice to rest
there."</p>

<p>"Has Father got a house there?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I once had a tiny peep at it. It was <em>so</em>
untidy, just as he likes things to be. Papers and
books all over the floor; clothes all unfolded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and a smell of tobacco in every room. He
called it a 'heavenly little house.'" And
Mother laughed merrily at the thought.</p>

<p>"Did you really <em>see</em> it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it was only a peep, you know.
He has seen the inside of mine once, and he
said he thought he would have to sleep outside
in the garden if he ever came to pay me
a visit. The house was far too neat and tidy
for a big clumsy man."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see the fairies?"</p>

<p>"Long, long ago. You see, once you have
been back to your little house they know that
you belong to the 'right people,' and only pay
you a visit on very special days."</p>

<p>"Oh, then shall I go back to my little
house again?" asked George.</p>

<p>"Of course you will, so long as you don't
become too grown-up. If you forget your house
it will fall into ruins, and by and by you will
never be able to find it again."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's what Alexander said!" answered
George.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There seemed to be no end to the things
George was learning from his adventures. One
day he said to Nurse: "The dragon's fortune&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>the
little dragon, I mean&mdash;lay right under his
nose, didn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Nurse, "right under his nose."</p>

<p>"Is mine under <em>my</em> nose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you look for it. It's been there all the
time." Nurse smiled more like a witch than ever.</p>

<p>George had a long talk with Alexander about
this. Although Alexander only <em>seemed</em> to <em>wuff-wuff</em>,
George was quite certain that he could
understand him now.</p>

<p>"I believe," said George, with his hands deep
in his pockets&mdash;<em>big</em> pockets he had specially
asked for&mdash;"I believe Mother's a piece of my
fortune, quite a large piece. Father's another
and"&mdash;here he hugged Alexander&mdash;"you're
another! Of course, I mustn't forget Nurse,"
he added.</p>

<p>Mother was very pleased when she heard this,
and one day after tea she showed George something
she had found in his room on the day he
came back from the Once-upon-a-Time Land.
They were leaves&mdash;golden-brown leaves&mdash;from
Tom Tiddler's sack! George had almost forgotten
about them.</p>

<p>"I have been keeping these safe for you," she
said. "You must not lose them. It would
never do to throw away your fortune."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; I would like to have them always, so
that I shall never forget. Now that I know
where my fortune is I don't want to go
searching for it again, though I <em>did</em> enjoy
myself."</p>

<p>Mother took a piece of paper out of the pocket
of her apron. "You remember that each of the
guests at your party gave you a present. What
were they? Do you know still, or have you
forgotten?"</p>

<p>George thought for some time. "I can half
guess, you know, but I'm not sure."</p>

<p>"Well, they gave you each a gift which you
could not buy for gold or jewels. Think of
what you would like to be?"</p>

<p>"I should like to be happy," said George at
once.</p>

<p>"That's one!"</p>

<p>"Oh, and healthy too. It's horrid to be ill,
and I should like to be brave like Sir Tristram
and ... oh, I know, full of fun and laughter
like the dragon."</p>

<p>"Yes; there are still some more."</p>

<p>"Well, wise like the witch or like Tom
Tiddler. Oh"&mdash;here he clapped his hands&mdash;"unselfish
like Alexander! He's always ready
to forgive me, even if I hurt him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander, who was lying at his feet, looked
up and wagged his tail.</p>

<p>"And what did the beautiful Queen give you?
Her present was the best of all!"</p>

<p>"The best of all?" How sweet she had
looked, the dear Queen, almost&mdash;no, just the
same as Mother!</p>

<p>"Have you guessed, dear?" said Mother,
bending down and kissing George.</p>

<p>In a moment he knew. "Of course, how
stupid of me! It's the last and the best!"
And he hugged her and Alexander in turns.</p>

<p class="p6"><em>What the Fairies Thought</em></p>


<p class="indent"><span class="drop-cap">P</span>UCK was sitting on top of his favourite
toadstool, balancing a blade of grass on
his nose. The fairies were watching
him do one trick after another with delight.
He wasn't the least bit cross now.</p>

<p>"<em>Ker-ek!</em>" croaked the old frog. "You
make me dizzy."</p>

<p>"Are you there still?" said Puck, turning
a somersault on to the ground. "I thought
your cold was no better."</p>

<p>"I haven't got a cold," grumbled the frog.
"I haven't <em>always</em> got a cold. Sometimes it's
a cold, sometimes it's not."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Puck, "you see, he came to
our party after all."</p>

<p>But the old frog didn't answer. He made all
kinds of queer noises, blew himself out like a
balloon, and really frightened the fairies. They
ran as fast as they could with dewdrops and
honey-balls&mdash;their medicine, you know&mdash;to help
him.</p>

<p>"I'm all right!" he gasped. "I'm all right.
I was only laughing."</p>

<p>This was too much for the fairies. They
laughed and laughed until they were tired,
for who had ever heard of an old frog laughing?</p>

<p>"What were you laughing at?" Puck asked.</p>

<p>"Why, at <em>you</em>, of course!" replied the old
frog. "Your party was delightful. It quite
cured my cold. And that boy of yours, George
Henry, is a nice little boy. I'll teach him to
swim one day."</p>

<p>This was quite a long speech for the old frog,
and he was quite hoarse for two days after it.</p>

<p>Puck stood up on a tall thistle and bowed
solemnly. "Listen!" he said. "George Henry
is a wonder-child. I said he was, and so he is.
If he hadn't had a large piece of fairyness in
him he would never, <em>never</em> have come to the
party at all. His great-great-great-grandmother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
you know, was quite half a fairy. And his
mother makes up stories about us in her head.
I knew I was right!"</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> clever!" cried the fairies in chorus.</p>

<p>"Am I not a clever Puck?" he cried, turning
head over heels. "Clever, clever, clever!" And
he danced round and round the old frog with
all the fairies after him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Well, that's a good thing! All the fairies
understand that George Henry is a kind of a
fairy, and quite believe that in time he will
grow more and more like one, although the
storks "<em>Pooh, pooh!</em>" whenever they hear this,
and ask: "What about us? He's <em>our</em> boy!"</p>

<p>George is growing up fast, and will soon be
a man&mdash;and yet that's not really true, for he's
not a man at all, but just George.</p>

<p>Alexander said one day&mdash;but you will have
to wait until another time to hear that!</p>
